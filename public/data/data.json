It speaks to the fact that normal life goes on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it might be abnormal, but it’s still going to exist. In the end, they are just like you and me, leading an ordinary life. The only difference is that they are living under occupation. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The individuals featured and the experiences shared by them, speak to a collective reimagining of what resistance in the face of aggression can look like — resistance that has taken the shape of music serenading patrons at the local watering hole, art that adorns the walls lining pavements and poetry gushing forth from the lips of brave women and men who know no other language. It is their celebration of life, love and hope, set against the backdrop of persecution and marginalization, with a singular belief at its core — in the end, love always wins.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Mirage Media team is entering the film into noteworthy international film festivals and has already won in a few: the Brussels International Film Festival Athens film festival, Rhode Island International Film Festival, Bushwick Film Festival, KIIF and North Dakota Human Rights Film Festival. The trailer was launched by Shruti Haasan and Rana Dagubatti. Occupied will be available to stream in April 2023.</span></p>\n",

So, we did a documentary on leprosy, we did a documentary on child abuse and we did a documentary on rape and prostitution. In regards to the marginalized communities in India, these conversations never came up in Hyderabad, especially in the environment that I was brought up in. But the lack of these discussions always stayed with me.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was concerned about the direction the country was heading </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the hatred, the violence, the hardships certain communities were going through. Although some of my best friends are Muslim, these conversations simply weren’t being had. It was really painful. A lot of my friends felt insecure about the country, especially India </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> we’re supposed to be the largest democracy in the world. People were worried that just because your name is Abdullah Aziz, something might happen to you. And they’re right to feel that way. On top of that, there was a lot going on in the Middle East, and I was always very </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conscious of what was happening with</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Palestine. I felt that the news I was consuming, the information that was being broadcasted and the kind of stories that were being told from their land was only about the pain and suffering. I knew a lot of people who wanted to get involved in the Middle East, but they found it extremely hard to go there and voice their opinions because of their religion. It was impossible to access Israel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About six years ago, I started doing a lot of reading on Palestine. I wanted to understand what was going on, on a deeper level </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> why were they fighting so resiliently, why there was so much pain and suffering and why it is that even now, in this day and age, we are unable to find a peaceful resolution. The main thing I noticed was that there was only one side of the narrative being told. And that made me want to take this story and dissect it further. Everyone around me said: “No Pranav, you&#8217;re insane, you should do something about the struggle in Kashmir because you are Hindu.” But in this situation, my religious identity was irrelevant to me. There was something very wrong in Palestine, and as a filmmaker, I felt the need to document and present it to the world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast forward to a couple of years later, I was still extremely interested in the Palestinian struggle. I was following it really closely and trying to understand what was happening in the West Bank and in Gaza. At this point the mentality at the company was: you have to do a lot of things that you don&#8217;t like in order to do things that you love. In order to run a company and keep ourselves afloat, we needed to make sure we’re paying salaries on time–so we were doing a lot of ads, weddings, you name it. Whatever work that came our way, we took it on, because I knew that eventually we’d make a big film about Palestine. I can’t even tell you why, but it was like a magnet. It’s all I was talking about, all I was reading about, all the films that I was watching. I had come across a fantastic film called </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6h-aTRf1mc\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inch&#8217;Allah</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and I was fascinated by how well it was shot. It got me thinking, maybe one day, I&#8217;ll be able to do this. There were so many people asking: “Why would you want to go there? It&#8217;s a war zone. There&#8217;s so much violence, why would you put yourself into a situation where you&#8217;re not going to be safe?” But I didn&#8217;t listen to anyone. </span></p>\n"

              "text": "<p><strong>Naomi</strong> Why did you decide to focus on the young, disenfranchised, creative Palestinians? I’d like to hear more about the interconnectedness of art and resistance.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pranav</strong> After taking a look at the kind of content that has been created over the years and the types of stories that I&#8217;ve come across, I felt the need to look at how young artists are dealing with the occupation outside of the realm of violence. If you look at history and at some of the finest artwork that exists, it&#8217;s always during times of violence or aggression. Art is a very powerful medium through which one is able to express oneself. There are so many stories of people suffering, people dying, people losing their loved ones, but no one has actually focused on Palestinians just living as Palestinians, irrespective of being occupied. There are so many people who are fighting this battle in other ways. I wanted to focus on how a musician is just writing a song and how a dancer is just dancing, forgetting about everything else that is going around </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> being able to find peace despite the world being in total chaos. What better way to talk about the life of a Palestinian than through the arts? </span></p>\n<p><strong>Naomi</strong> How many of your team members went to Palestine? When exactly was this and where did you live?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pranav</strong> About three years ago, we met this fantastic guy called Shadi Zaqtan</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at an airport. My wife and I were traveling to Bangkok for a friend&#8217;s wedding but we decided to make a stopover in Vietnam. And at the airport in Vietnam, my wife went up to a group of people asking for a cigarette. One of the guys turned out to be Palestinian. She came back to me and said: “Pranav, this guy&#8217;s from Palestine, you&#8217;ve been saying that you want to go, why don’t you go and talk to him?” He was really interested in why an Indian wanted to talk about Palestine when there&#8217;s already so much chaos going on in India. In the middle of the airport, after a couple of minutes of us exchanging our Facebook, telephone numbers, etc., he said: “Pranav, since you&#8217;re so mad about Palestine, I&#8217;ll do one thing for you. If you ever come to Palestine, you just message me, and I&#8217;ll hook you up with every single thing that you need. And if you ever need a place to stay you can come and stay with me.” I remember thinking: This guy&#8217;s just talking out of his ass. He&#8217;s just saying it because we&#8217;re at the airport. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m ever going to meet him again in my life.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, it happened. I wouldn’t say we had enough money but we had money for the plane tickets. It was me, Arvin and Prithvi who flew to Israel. I texted him shortly before we arrived and he told me: “You can come and stay with me.” But I still wasn’t really sure… I didn&#8217;t even know this guy. I had met him at an airport once. What were the chances? This was too good to be true. So, I was a little bit worried, on top of everything else. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One week before leaving, I had proposed to my girlfriend and got engaged, so my in-laws weren&#8217;t too happy that I was leaving. My parents didn&#8217;t know where I was going. They found out a couple of days before I left and told me I was insane. When we landed in Tel Aviv we went to Jerusalem straight away and I called up Shadi from Jerusalem. He told me: “Come to my house in Ramallah, you’ll stay with me.” And for the next 35 days I stayed with the most generous person I have ever met. I&#8217;ve never come across anyone more generous or with bigger hearts than the Palestinians, especially Shadi. I speak for both the team and myself when I say this </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> he changed our lives. Despite everything they&#8217;re going through they&#8217;re still willing to give. I find that phenomenal. I didn&#8217;t even realize how famous of a musician Shadi is in Palestine, that all came out later. He said to me: “Pranav, you’re doing something for Palestine, the least I can do is provide accommodation for you and the team.”</span></p>\n<p><strong>Naomi</strong> What was navigating Palestine like for you and your team? Did they welcome you with open arms?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pranav</strong> It was fabulous. In the beginning, everyone wanted to know where we are from, who we are, etc. But by the fourth/fifth day, they would say, “Habibi come have some coffee and tea with me. Come talk to me. Can I get you some dinner? Can I take you for a ride?” After some time when we were taking taxis, they would recognize me: “Hey, you’re Pranav, you&#8217;re from Hyderabad </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you&#8217;re the Indian.” I felt like I was in India, like this guy&#8217;s known me for 10-15 years, over the course of a week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to so many people’s homes for coffee, we had drinks here and there, people would host us for dinner </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> everyone was so welcoming, especially after they found out that we&#8217;re making a film on Palestine. It was truly an impeccable experience. I don’t have the words to describe the kind of the journey we went on. They know many people from their neighboring countries aren’t willing to do something for them and so having a random team from India care so much, they were beyond grateful, as were we. It felt like I&#8217;ve lived there in my past life, like I was actually a Palestinian. I put my entire life savings into this project. It was hard, but I wanted to do it. I believed in the cause. I didn&#8217;t go there to talk about the Israelis or Palestinians. I just went there to talk about what I see and what the camera sees. The narrative will dictate itself, the visuals, the people </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you&#8217;ll understand everything just by seeing what I&#8217;m showing you. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&#8217;s something about the Palestinians in general, that sort of draws you to them. Every word that they speak is poetic, their approach towards life. They&#8217;re just grateful </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about who they are, what they have. In my experience, you will never find them complaining about anything. And I felt that was a great lesson for every single human being to learn. That aspect really came across beautifully in every episode that we made </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> they were just being themselves, despite the daily troubles that they were facing due to the occupation. They never dwell on the problem that they&#8217;re facing, they&#8217;ll always talk about how happy they are and how they&#8217;re moving ahead. It’s such an inspiration and I wanted to depict that within </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Occupied</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n"

Or were they eager to get their voices heard?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pranav </strong>We did a lot of research for a couple of years. We definitely had a vision and some idea of what kind of characters we wanted </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> there should be one musician, one artist, one calligraphist, one dancer, one political tour guide, etc. But like every great documentary, nothing works out once you’re on the ground. Either things get better or they get worse. And honestly, the narrative is built while you&#8217;re editing anyway.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I actually sent Shadi an email saying: “These are the kinds of characters that they&#8217;re looking for.” His response was casual: “Don’t worry, I&#8217;ll sort everything out for you.” I remember thinking, dude, this guy&#8217;s taking things really lightly. We&#8217;ve been putting years of research into this and he’s responding with one line answers… But I’m the kind of guy who will either go all in or I won&#8217;t do it at all. So I decided to take Shadi’s word for it. He’s basically a musician who runs a bar. And on the second or third day of our Palestine trip, he said: “Pranav, come to the bar, let me introduce you to everyone that I know.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within five minutes, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">my impression of literally every single person improved by 100%</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While we were shooting this documentary, we were actually having so many conversations rather than just shooting all the time. I would go to Hamza’s house, the calligraphy artist, and I would sit there chatting with his mom. The team would go shooting somewhere else and later we’d be having conversations with his dad… It felt like I was just there on holiday but I happened to carry a camera around.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And things just fell into place </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> every single person, every single story, every single character that we had, for them it was just an ordinary story, but for anyone looking in it was truly extraordinary. All our characters were phenomenal. A lot of the trip was merely about spending time with them </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to be honest, we just got really lucky. Many told us: “You can&#8217;t be carrying such heavy equipment because they’ll know that you&#8217;re up to something fishy.” But somehow we never got stopped while entering Israel. We were lucky to even come back to India with all that footage. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Naomi </strong>What are some misconceptions about Palestinians and Islam that are debunked in your documentary?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pranav </strong>The biggest misconceptions people have of those in the Middle East is that they’re backwards, they’re violent and they’re uneducated. In reality, they are by far the most intelligent and compassionate lot of people I’ve ever come across. But the whole narrative is spun in a certain way. When you see the documentary you’ll understand what I mean. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shadi is such an incredible speaker, he’s a true performer. He’s a Muslim who runs a bar in the heart of Ramallah and he loves playing music. These are three things that every single person who is so-called religious will say is the biggest sin that one can do. But just like anyone else, who am I to judge whether what he is doing is right or wrong? It’s his own relationship to God, who am I to decide? People like to talk but when it comes to being actionable, no one really wants to do anything; everyone wants to take a step back because they don&#8217;t want to get out of their own comfort zone. A lot of creators have great ideas but few actually want to go ahead and do the work, because it’s hard. I could have joined the commercial industry and made a shit ton of money but I wanted to work on stories that moved me. Not stories that are governed by my financial status. The universe works in mysterious ways and I know I’m lucky to make a decision like that. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Naomi </strong>There&#8217;s been a lot of discussion surrounding the term “conflict” when speaking about what&#8217;s happening in Israel and Palestine. Within the current discourse, would you say that this word is an accurate depiction of what&#8217;s going on?</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pranav</strong> As an Indian, I have more rights than a Palestinian. A Palestinian does not have an Israeli passport and only has a Palestinian ID. They cannot walk the same road as an Israeli. Is that not apartheid in the 21st century? When people talk about a conflict, there’s two sides. How are there two sides when one side is completely armed and puts a 765 feet wall around people who literally have no food or water? They control the electricity, control every single meal that they eat. Gaza is like a concentration camp. The West Bank is controlled by the Israelis. At the check point, which will literally take me three minutes to go through, it would take an average Palestinian at least an hour and a half. If the soldier was in a bad mood that day he could decide to send them off. And for that Palestinian, a loved one might be dying. Someone might need his help. He might want to see his grandmother or his mother. But if an Israeli soldier decided that he&#8217;s not going to cross — to another Palestinian village, I might add — then he can’t. The Israeli soldier always has more rights. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people calling this a conflict </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> what are we talking about? Settlers go in there and piss on the Palestinian’s water tanks, just to make sure that the Palestinians cannot have water to drink or to have a bath. And I’ve seen this with my own eyes. I&#8217;ve seen settlers shout at young Palestinian children in Hebron telling them: “You’re filthy, you need to be thrown out, this is my land, this is my country.” And the Palestinian kid will look back and tell him: “My grandmother is older than you,” with a smile on his face. I asked this 11-year old kid, doesn&#8217;t this hurt you? And he told me: “I will never give an Israeli or a settler the pleasure to see me in pain.” I found that extremely powerful. It&#8217;s not a conflict, it&#8217;s ethnic cleansing, it’s apartheid, it’s taking complete control over people just because you have money and guns. This might be the situation now, but I truly believe that what’s just will always overcome. </span></p>\n"

For me, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Occupied</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is extremely personal. When you expect something from someone or something, you always end up disappointed. I feel that Palestine has given me more than what I can ever give Palestine. I am blessed to have the opportunity to film this as a young filmmaker. The overarching message for the viewer is: We never actually know what is going on in someone&#8217;s mind </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the pain and suffering that one goes through </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">until we actually converse and understand where it&#8217;s coming from. It&#8217;s easy for us to read a little bit and talk about it, but until we actually go and see it ourselves we are not here to pass judgment. I feel that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Occupied</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a small window into seeing how less is more, how one can be grateful for life and how one finds happiness irrespective of how much pain the others will always inflict onto you.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Occupied</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a journey of Palestinians. It&#8217;s a journey of how they are living with hope, with energy, with joy, with love, with laughter. Everyone in Palestine is going through their own version of the occupation. Every single person is affected differently. Some people don&#8217;t get water, some people don&#8217;t get electricity, some people&#8217;s wives have been shot, someone’s mother has been stopped at a checkpoint, someone&#8217;s house has been stolen. Yes, all of that is happening, that will definitely come across in the film, but the beauty lies in the fact that although the Israelis control a lot, no one can actually control your mind, your voice, your thoughts and your intention. You can be physically beaten, you can be physically broken but the minute you are mentally broken that is when you let them win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every single day I wake up, I say I wish I could have done more, I wish I could have shot more, I could have made it better. But I’m not going to tell you this is what you are supposed to feel. The film will let you feel </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">period. You will love the music, you will love the poetry, you will love the people, you will love the stories. Whether you are for the cause or against it, it will do that much. It will occupy a place in your heart.</span></p>\n"

I make my tracks to comfort myself, but I would be grateful if someone else could feel encouraged by them. I am not the most talkative person, so I think I communicate through my music –– making music makes my mind become much lighter, as if I’ve told someone something that was weighing heavily on me. It’s important for me to share that connection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My music is composed of different sounds. Sometimes ballad, sometimes rock, sometimes pop. I wish there weren’t a line between mainstream and non-mainstream music. I just wish people could feel comfortable listening to any music they want. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My childhood dream was to become a pianist. However, I had to adapt when I hurt my arm while snowboarding in sixth grade and underwent surgery. I held onto my dream of working with music, but I took this as an opportunity to look in a different direction. I started to experiment with making music through computer programs. I love to research and teach myself new skills. YouTube didn’t exist at the time, so I got a lot of help from friends as well as from music teachers. I also learned new instruments little by little. It is very fun for me to learn how to play instruments I am not familiar with, and right now I’m learning the bass. I also find inspiration from paintings, art, films, photographs, books, poems, etc. </span></p>\n"

There are many good aspects of the culture here to get to know about, so I am glad that the doors seem to be opening. It still amazes me when I get DMs from international listeners.</p>\n<p>I tend to isolate myself, but I love being active with the stage name Onthedal. It means “on the moon.” My dream is to encourage and connect with listeners rather than to become a famous rockstar. I wish for my music to offer others solace.</p>\n"

But these days, Korea seems to be embracing diverse sounds from our own local music scene. I feel elated that we are increasingly proud of our own musicians. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are still many different sounds I want to explore. I want to be more creative. There are many sides I haven’t shown before and I am afraid to be pigeonholed into one field or genre. As I experiment with completely different sounds, I hope that can still be embraced. I have also been into rock for a long time, and recently I have been exploring that field as well. Currently I play drums for the band Galaxy Express. That feels like a full circle. </span></p>\n"

As a female queer DJ, I find so much inspiration from other queer musicians and female artists. This doesn’t mean I want to exclude men, but I want women and queer clubgoers to feel safe and enjoy good vibes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The music industry here is slowly becoming more inclusive. There is a party called Shade Seoul that fosters queer DJs. The younger generation in Seoul seems to be more open minded.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I find inspiration in so many places. I watch a lot of interviews with artists that I am interested in, not just music-wise. People who are empathetic or who have a mission to help the community out, and to help people feel a sense of belonging. </span></p>\n"

If I had to try, I&#8217;d describe it as experimental electronic music with East Asian traditional sounds, specifically using Korean traditional instruments. I am into merging sounds. Doing so gets unexpected results. My identity is a big part of my process as well. Being Korean and having lived in London, these experiences are expressed through my sound. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Inner-self EP,” my latest EP, released in the beginning of June, is about looking into what happened in the past and present, and about self-reflection. As I get older I find myself looking back more than looking ahead. I lost my mom in March of 2021 and it made me think about where she is now. That led me to think about the lives of people from the past and those of us who are living now. My mom is gone completely, but somehow she continues to exist by constantly impacting me. She’s still giving me something. So many people have left us, but we somehow still feel their influence. I was making music while she was sick and it made me think more about how our existence impacts each other. I also consider our ancestors in my latest music video and sample old music. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I started playing music three years ago and taught myself through Ableton Live. The only previous musical experience I had was from playing piano as a child. When I moved to London I got into the party scene there and that influenced me a lot. </span></p>\n"

Rather than just focusing on drone sounds and calm sounds, we want to create dancey sounds too. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We met through mutual friends and we hung out together a lot through the dance club scene. The more we talked and got to know each other, the more we realized we had similar tastes. We felt a great synergy and always talked about music together, recommending tracks to each other, talking about the kind of sound we wanted to create. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our music is all about storytelling. Before we create sounds, we come up with visuals and a storyline. We get inspired by things like Uman’s (one of our duo) drawings, movies, and other visuals. There is one piece by Uman where a person is falling asleep inside a colorful tiled bathtub. We began to develop a story around what that person might be dreaming about inside that bathtub. We really like fantasy –– the unreal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don’t make music for the feedback, but it does encourage and motivate us. There are people who find electronic music difficult to understand, but we believe you shouldn’t feel like you have to be knowledgeable about it to simply enjoy and feel it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We feel proud of the Korean music scene: K-Pop these days is loved internationally. Beyond K-Pop, there really is a diversity of music in Korea. I hope more attention can be given to this other music, even within the country. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don’t like the term underground, I personally prefer the term subculture. Some terms seem divisive. The term “underground” has a different connotation here. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Seoul alone, there are many subcultures nestled within subcultures. There are so many genres, scenes, and artists that go undiscovered. But they’re there. It’s also exciting to think how much there is still out there to discover. </span></p>\n"

The objects in this series are taken from his everyday memories with her: the bowls they ate with, the clothes she wore, her daily medications.

The thought of my broken Chinese being folded into a small goodbye note felt wrong. How could I say everything to you when we never really spoke? Talking was not in our vocabulary. After all, the language we shared didn&#8217;t need translating.</p>\n<p>Do you remember when I would feel unwell, you’d place your rough watery hands on my back. Shaking loose small drops of white flower oil. You’d knead and roll your weight into me. A damp heat would seep through my skin. The sound of your jade bracelet would rattle alongside my heavy breath like the percussion of a requiem. Can you tell I am feeling unwell now Mama? You were never really proud of the man I was in England, perhaps because you never really knew him. I’d stripped him off in the bathroom. A heavy shower washing away any traces of my British Identity. Not once have I heard you say my English name. To you I was not <em>that</em>, to you I was your grandson.</p>\n"

Soft currents of grey, white and silver floated around your head in the spring months. When I was younger your hair was permed. Tight curls would frame your small face. I’d watch you place one small felt ribbon within your curls. You would always finish this routine by softly patting both of your palms over your head, as if crowning yourself. First prize to Hong Kong’s new beauty queen.</p>\n<p>I even liked everything you wore. A tiny pantry-like wardrobe stood by your bed. It was filled with shades of purple cardigans. Raisin, prune, dry salty plum, ingredients to dress a Grandma. In the evening you’d wear white cotton pajamas decorated with blossom flowers. Their petals would roll down your sloping back. I would rest my head on you. Your hand would eventually brush me off and I too would glide, float, roll all the way back home. Is there a word in Chinese for when leaves fall off trees and they land back onto earth? I often felt like that leaving you.</p>\n"

              "text": "<p>My Chinese was never strong enough for you. Going back to Hong Kong was an act of re-finding my mother tongue. But conversations or language were not needed in this relationship. Our relationship was not formed by the tellings of your past or feelings. I didn’t even know your name. This relationship was like no other, it was built by presence. Something I have reluctantly learned through the repetition of my father’s actions. Is this what<i> Chinese Love </i>is? Did you teach him that? To cook, to feed, to be near? Do you remember how I’d run to you if I heard you walking down the stairs, offering my hand to make sure you wouldn’t fall? How I’d  bring you a tray of breakfast, tea with buttered toast and microwaved sausages? A seven year old’s attempt at a gourmet meal. I’d wait for you if we were walking too fast. I am still waiting for you, but I am now learning how to walk ahead of you.</p>\n<p>What do I do now. I find myself rubbing your oil on my chest before I sleep. I burn incense so I can smell you. I eat too much because my father does not have the words or the language either. My mouth is full of food, swallowing emotions so they do not have to be shared and digested amongst others during family meals. I smile and mask a heartbreak by asking for seconds, clinging onto a childhood that’s departing. I wish I could return to you and feed you like I once did.  It’s not until I am in your room alone that my words feel too heavy.  Where I sit alone with a grief that weighs on me like tropical heat. Where no words leave me, just a heavy breath burning out my throat.  I realize this is as close as I’ll get to you. So I rest my head on your pillow where we once laid. I close my eyes, waiting to feel your hand on my back. I won’t say a word or speak a sentence as you know I have come back for you. You do not need my words or language to know that. I am finally fluent, speaking a language you once taught me.</p>\n"

A karaoke machine and some disco lights not-so-discreetly framed the entrance, indications of pre-covid celebrations. Among several framed pictures of the royal family, nostalgic depictions of Thailand and a wall of May&#8217;s cookbook, a poster advertising a fruit carving class caught my eye, and I signed up immediately.</p>\n",

My family owned and operated a farm and I remember long arduous days working in the fields. We would grow rice primarily, but also small amounts of onions and indigenous greens. Many of the people in the area where I was born have roots in Laos, and therefore Laotian influence is evident in the local culture, including the food. You&#8217;ll notice on the May Kaidee menu there are Isaan dishes which refers to the North-East Thailand region with Laotian influence where I&#8217;m originally from.</p>\n<p>I started with just a food cart in Bangkok in 1988 and was soon introduced to vegetarianism by my aunt and uncle who owned a vegetarian restaurant. I made what foreigners call &#8220;street food.&#8221; In Thailand it&#8217;s where some of the best food is made despite how the name might sound. I made items popular with tourists like Pad Thai, as well as numerous items favored by locals, particularly Isaan dishes.</p>\n<p><strong>Lulu</strong> How did you get into veganism? How did you decide to start a restaurant?</p>\n<p><strong>May</strong> After my aunt and uncle retired I took over their restaurant and that became the first May Kaidee location. The menu was actually 99% vegan at the time, so later it was easy to drop the couple of non-vegan items from the menu. I gravitated to a vegetarian and vegan diet originally for health reasons, but later found it to be great for business as well.</p>\n"

In the UK I was involved with a pop-up restaurant, in Russia a Krishna temple and in Japan an organic farm. I spent a few months in each country. The trip to Russia was interesting. I experienced snow for the first time there. The country is quite different from places I had been to previously, and I don&#8217;t think most people know there are locations like Krishna temples in Russia. It was truly a unique experience. The trip to Japan had the closest feel to the environment in Thailand I&#8217;m used to. It was a great complement to my existing knowledge of Asian cuisine and culture. The UK was interesting in that I was able to see my Bangkok customers on their home turf. Most of my Bangkok customers historically were from the UK but I had always interacted with them as tourists passing through Bangkok while on holiday. It was a nice role reversal to be the tourist myself at the times I wasn&#8217;t helping run the pop-up.</p>\n<p><strong>Lulu</strong> What made you decide to come to New York?</p>\n<p><strong>May</strong> The U.S. was always on my list of overseas destinations after having spent time in the U.K., Japan and Russia developing Thai vegan projects there. NYC specifically is where I have the largest support network in the U.S.</p>\n<p><strong>Lulu</strong> What is the Thai community like here?</p>\n<p><strong>May</strong> The Thai community in NYC is supportive and I enjoy attending cultural events throughout the year. The Thai consulate has on many occasions chosen May Kaidee to provide the vegan Thai option for their events which has been an honor.</p>\n"

They were all similar as our team (including my sister, sister-in-law and other relatives) spent decades learning to cook the food the same way at our main Bangkok location. The food at the NYC is very close to the way the dishes taste in Thailand because we&#8217;re able to source nearly identical ingredients here. For example high quality lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and galangal are now grown in the U.S., with the same flavor as those grown in SE Asia. In terms of locations, everything changed however once the pandemic started. We had to close all of the Thailand locations and in a sense I was brought back to the days of the first May Kaidee with just one location and a team of two people. However just in the past month my sister reopened a small May Kaidee in Bangkok and my sister-in-law reopened a small May Kaidee in Chiang Mai.</p>\n<p><strong>Lulu</strong> What is something you would like people to know about Thai cuisine?</p>\n<p><strong>May</strong> We have a holistic approach that places importance on the aesthetics of food: color combinations of ingredients, stylized cutting, and an emphasis on freshness and flavor.</p>\n<p><strong>Lulu</strong> What&#8217;s the best way for people to support local businesses like yours?</p>\n<p><strong>May</strong> The best way to support a local independent business like mine is to find your favorite places and then consistently order from them. Things fluctuate so much in this business that having steady customers, even if they are ordering minimally one item per week, helps tremendously. I have many customers who order a single dish once a week consistently and those customers in a sense form a safety net that allows me to make it to the next month. Of course the customers who come twice a year for a large dinner party are equally important, but it&#8217;s those small consistent weekly orders that ensure the lights remain on.</p>\n"

She recalls as a child playing make believe and drawing with her friends in an abandoned house next to her own. “It was kind of a wild time–simple and precious. Nowadays, people aren&#8217;t allowed on those fields anymore. I wonder if the abandoned house is still there.”</p>\n",

I like to play with them, maybe even start a soccer game together. I keep this kind of relationship with them, so they always come to me unexpectedly, like a surprise grab bag. I often ask them, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; and laugh, but when I make a sad piece, they will try to comfort me. They all have their own personalities, I take time to get to know them when I create them and have conversations in the process. Still, there will always be some mysterious characters whom I can&#8217;t really tell what they are thinking.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lulu</strong> How would you describe yourself?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Teng</strong> I feel like I alternate between being overly rational and overly emotional, but in the end, they&#8217;re kind of the same thing. I use my rational side to suppress my emotional side, and vice versa. The moment I start to become aware of my own &#8220;innocence,&#8221; I&#8217;m no longer innocent. There may still be some part of me that remains under the surface. Sometimes I feel distressed, sometimes I feel grateful. The last time I saw a beautiful child smile at me on the bus, I cried.</p>\n"

Although I really love art and went to art school, I subconsciously never wanted it to be my job. I really wanted to keep it as pure as possible, so I tried working a lot of different jobs to support my hobby. In the end, though, that made me realize my favorite thing in life couldn&#8217;t just be a hobby. I had to take art more seriously by making it a career and living for it. It took a lot of time to adjust to this new mindset, but I try to remind myself of where I started every day.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lulu</strong> Do you keep a journal or a sketchbook?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Teng</strong> I keep both, I always have an A5 size sketchbook with me since it&#8217;s lightweight and easy to carry. Drawing is like journaling to me – I can capture my mood in the moment as well as some subconscious, unspeakable things. But I also have a 10-year habit of writing down thoughts. Most of time I don&#8217;t really think about what I&#8217;m writing besides capturing the moment.</p>\n"

It&#8217;s hard to control myself, which bothers me sometimes, especially at work where I have to learn how to be more stable. But whenever I feel like drawing, as long as there is some kind of instrument, I will be fine.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lulu</strong> What&#8217;s your favorite cartoon?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Teng</strong> This is a really hard question! As a kid, all sorts of cartoons and animations helped me feel less lonely, so I can&#8217;t really choose a favorite. But I&#8217;ve been rewatching The Powerpuff Girls lately and realized how much it influenced me! It&#8217;s such a cool and timeless show. A couple of episodes deeply scared me when I was a child, like the ones with the clown and the magician. I love it.</p>\n"

I think I formed a rather balanced relationship with it. I used to spend so much time on MSN Spaces, blogging, and playing around with Photoshop, but then I also went out every day to have my little adventures in the woods and used my imagination. I’m grateful for both, as both made a huge impact on my life and art. I consciously try not to let the internet take over my whole life. I need a balanced life to keep creating. That being said, it has indeed changed our minds. It’s like a big runway show nowadays – we all have to learn how to display ourselves.</p>\n<p>Still, I have met all kinds of different artists and wonderful people around the world through the internet. I have absorbed tons of inspiration; it&#8217;s amazing how we can open up new horizons every second. All of our creations seem to be becoming more and more hybrid, and the gap between everyone has become smaller. As a result, distinctiveness has become more precious. Everyone wants to be special and different, it’s exciting to witness. But maybe one day we will all get tired of being “special,” and &#8220;ordinary&#8221; will become the new fashion. But what is ordinary anyway?</p>\n<p>So I guess I both love and am afraid of the internet. It is a very contradictory feeling. There have been moments where I thought I couldn’t live without it. Now I prefer small events that I stumble upon in real life – the shape of the leaves, the shadows of you and I, a smile. Maybe the internet will blur the boundaries between people even more in the future, but I still hope that people can cherish these beautiful sparks of life more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

Life and death are both beautiful.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Lulu</strong> What are your dreams like?</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Teng</strong> I&#8217;ve been dreaming the same dream since I was a child. In that dream I&#8217;m deep in the black ocean, disoriented and unsure of where I am. All I feel is just pure fear from the bottom of my heart. When I look up, I realize I have been locked into some kind of laboratory – people in white robes observing me from &#8220;up there.&#8221; Then some huge deep-sea creatures with big, sharp, weird-looking teeth start to surround me. In order to survive, I have to swing to the only tiny land in this whole black ocean, it&#8217;s horrifying! I still dream of this sometimes…but there have been sweet dreams about the deep ocean too.</p>\n"

We are always surrounded by flowers like these, and if we become careless, even if they’re beautiful they can hurt. So, being innocent can be dangerous. To be so is flawed.

Alec compares the &#8220;anime lover&#8221; label to a 9-5 job for Asians, constantly having to live up to others&#8217; ideas of them.

In their own words, Chengdu permeates its complex cultural texture, embraced and incubated by the Funan River. Their experience growing up in Chengdu led to the realization of their sexual orientation, and thus a consciousness of queer identity. In this project, Yuhan documents the girls around them who possess different sexualities and self-identities. It gives birth to fluid identity construction in the process of socialization, just like the water in Funan River. Tides and floods, where the river crosses and flows; dynamic waterways are engaged by natural and manmade interference.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Yuhan Cheng</strong> I took a gap year in 2020 to go back home. It inspired me to create </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Princess of  Funan River</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To me, this is a project about looking back and retrospection. I have included a variety of  locations in this project, from places that have been forgotten (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Closed Underground Mall</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), places that have been abandoned (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lulu</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), places that are called home (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mom’s Quilt, Yujia</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), and places that I called home in the short-term (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zeqi, Didi</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).</span></p>\n"

I photographed Yujia in their family storage, which is also their studio when their mom is not home. There&#8217;s a big Guan Yin portrait and an album of  classical music in the back, a wooden statue that they use to hang their jewelry… I think this studio carries their personality and background as a whole. As someone who comes from a strict family, I think it is so brave that they wanted to do a nude portrait. It made me think about my relationship to my body and how I see it.</span></p>\n",

Whenever I was home before, I would always lock myself up in my </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">room. I actively widened the gap between myself and my family by refusing to communicate, yet this project made me think more about opening up by looking back.  </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without this “looking back” process, I perhaps would never have appreciated the beauty of the city and how my family connects me to who I was before today. Chengdu, a fastly growing city, has changed a lot since the time I grew up. I believe this has happened to most of the cities in China, yet it is still impactful and meaningful to us because these changes in Chengdu also changed the people that have been through such changes. This does not mean I romanticize the old and undeveloped Chengdu, but I certainly do miss it. Changes are necessary to welcome something new. People come and go as buildings are built and torn down. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man-made river, Funan, will eventually converge with the Yangtze River and to the sea.

It is simply a prerequisite for many artists who treat the object as a blank surface upon which to create their artwork. With the proliferation of digital tools, tangible media like paper may even appear obsolete. For multidisciplinary artist <a href=\"http://www.honghong.studio/\">Hong Hong</a>, however, paper is the artwork, and the craft of papermaking a site-specific performance piece. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resulting papers are both works of individual creative expression and practical records of the unique environmental factors allowed to converge at the moment of production. Hong Hong displays a series of works, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wet and the Dry: Holding and Grasping,” </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in a new exhibition curated by Jamillah Hinson and Marissa Del Toro, titled “<a href=\"https://www.nxthvn.com/calendar/let-them-roam-freely/\">Let Them Roam Freely</a>” with Darryl DeAngelo Terrell, on display at <a href=\"https://www.nxthvn.com/\">NXTHVN</a> in New Haven, CT, March 5 – May 15, 2022.

My family immigrated to the US in 1999. My parents received their green cards after a six-year wait, which was a scary, grueling, and expensive process. However, I was automatically kicked off of their permanent resident application when I turned 21 in 2010. Despite having lived in the US since I was 10 years old, I would be deported if I didn’t secure a full-time, “legitimate” job or a spot in an academic program immediately after graduating with my BFA.</p>\n<p>So I entered the MFA Program with a focus in Drawing and Painting at the University of Georgia in 2011. I was keenly aware that I would have to deal with the USCIS after graduate school ended. Would I have to go back to China? Would I be forced to become an undocumented resident? Within this context, the repetitive analysis of paintings for their formal qualities seemed banal. I didn’t know why I was there, and in a way, I really didn’t want to be there. At the same time, I dreaded graduation. There were all of these desperate feelings inside of me.</p>\n<p>In early 2012, I knew that I wouldn’t make another painting ever again. I don’t know why: it was just a sensation that I couldn’t shake. I initially liked being in the papermaking studio because it was on the first floor. Going there meant I would be far away from Drawing and Painting, which was on the third floor. The room was usually quiet, and I was often there alone. I liked being able to hear the sound of water meeting water, as I made paper. In the end, this practice allowed me to remember, revisit and cherish my girlhood and my memories. It was the necessary pivot toward my own history, the histories of my family and the land that I was exiled from. In a way, it was some kind of homecoming.</p>\n"

I like them because everybody touches, knows and understands them. Cheap things are garbage, and I like garbage. We throw it away. We don’t want to look at or remember the daily wreckage of our own lives. But we somehow keep making more and more of it, day after day, month after month. We can’t stop, even if we wanted to. There is something beautiful about working with the debris and the ruins of our world. Every sheet of paper was once the body of a living tree. Sometimes I forget that.<strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ariana</strong> Can you speak about the artistic and physical process behind &#8220;The Wet and the Dry: Holding and Grasping I and II?&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Hong</strong> The birds fly south and then north each year. Like the clouds, they move freely through a borderless expanse. Everything wants to return home. But, unlike the birds, I don&#8217;t know where home is or how to get there. Since 2015, I have traveled to faraway locations across the US to create site-responsive, monumental paperworks. I begin each piece by pouring a mixture of pulverized materials and water into a frame that sits beneath the sky. As these substances cure, foliage, debris and insects from the surroundings fall into and become a part of the paper. Passing storms register as ridges and tears on its surface. Each sheet is a photographic still of the time and place it was made: it acts as a geographical and meteorological marker for the voyage of my own body in time and through space. Through the activities of mapping and map-making, I was trying to answer my own questions about homecoming and loss. The pieces in the show were made in three places: Houston (TX), Beverly (MA), and New Haven (CT).</p>\n"

Are there any traditional practices that define your craft or traditions you intentionally break?</p>\n<p><strong>Hong</strong> I grew up in China in the 1990s. My apoor (grandmother) told me when I was young that the sky was the room of some unknown god. I used to go with her to the Buddhist temple to pray. We wrote down our wishes on strips of holy paper that we&#8217;d tie to the branches of a tree inside the temple. From these early experiences, I understood paper as a metaphysical, transcendental object, capable of bridging the material with the immaterial.<br />\nI also remember reading an essay about the Great Four Inventions when I was in first or second grade. One of those inventions was paper, which dates back to the Han Dynasty. Despite automation and industrialization, this particular process hasn’t changed much. The most important step is the formation of felted fibers into a thin sheet on a mat or some type of screen. Much later, I would revisit and reconstruct this craft through my own practice. I view tradition as a trans-temporal and trans-spatial channel. A group of people, who will never meet each other, were somehow compelled to engage in the same activity, whether it is prayer or making paper.</p>\n<p>To me, tradition is one way to dissolve time and distance. It is a bridge between myself and another, as well as between the present moment and an unknowable past. I don’t view it as a set of predetermined parameters, which is why I don’t think about rule-breaking very much. For me, tradition is about what we have always yearned for. It is about what time, death, and individual circumstance cannot touch, cannot ravage, cannot dilute.</p>\n"

What do “wet” and “dry” represent?</p>\n<p><strong>Hong</strong> Wet and dry represent the different states of the materials during the process of hand paper formation. As water evaporates from the gelatinous and wet mixture of bark, repurposed paper and pigment, it cures and transitions into a flexible, cohesive surface. They also reference our experiences of seasons and climates, as well as the complicated ways these fluctuations are internalized and carried within our bodies as knowledge. When I was working on this project at NXTHVN, I had just finished a book that means a lot to me –– “Indexcards” by Moyra Davey. There was a chapter in it titled The Wet and the Dry. Finishing the book opened a void: I knew I wouldn’t be able to encounter it for the first time again. It was simultaneously inside of me and behind me. I simply wanted to pay homage to its significance to me.</p>\n<p><strong>Ariana</strong> How does your work reflect your own voyage, both throughout the course of your life and specific to the locations your work brings you?</p>\n<p><strong>Hong</strong> I’m very interested in Chinese folklore. I think folklore, at its most essential, is about cosmological order. If the universe is a series of concentric circles that reverberate from each other, where do we belong within that system or whole? Again, this goes back to the idea of mapping. And what is a myth if not a map? Every story is a diagrammatic representation of where we come from and where we will one day go. I talked about each sheet of paper as a geographical and meteorological marker for the voyage of my body in time and through space. I think the projects are just that: a catalog of locations and a reconstitution of where I have been. I lost my body when I came to America. To put it a different way: when I was 10 years old, I lost my body. So, all work is really the same work. All work is a search for a body: mine. All work is an attempt to recreate, rebuild and reclaim a body: my own.</p>\n"

In this nomadic practice, traditional methods of Chinese papermaking coalesces with painting, monastic rituals and feminist performances.

In Sarah’s own words, the video aims to be “a simplistic visual, playing on the beat and dreamy feel of the track, referencing the lyrical themes of duality with inspiration from the colours and tones in Wong Kar Wai’s films. The video cuts between two scenes in the intro, the peachy daylight scene and electric blue evening scene, we wanted the colour to reflect the feeling of eastern cities similar to the tones created so beautifully in Chungking Express.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Below is an interview between Lulu Yao Gioiello and Miso Extra.</p>\n"

Being mixed heritage has allowed me to draw on such a wide pool of reference points which makes for interesting art. Subsequently this allows me to make more authentic music as it feels closer to how I would want to express myself in day to day life.</p>\n<p><strong>Lulu</strong> I read that you started taking music more seriously during the pandemic. How have the past few years changed you and your relationship to music? What were you doing before you started focusing on music?</p>\n<p><strong>Miso</strong> I feel for a long time I was waiting to be given permission to make music. I often flirted with the idea and would daydream about being an artist for years but the pause on usual life really allowed me to take stock and fully immerse myself into my passions.</p>\n"

It was through one of those online connections and I was honestly so elated when she agreed to write a verse! It sounds all the more incredible for it. I truly get goosebumps.</p>\n<p><strong>Lulu</strong> What subject matter is most important to you when communicating through your songs?</p>\n<p><strong>Miso</strong> I never set out to communicate with intent. The subject matter varies and it isn’t really till after the song is written that I sometimes discover what it was that I’m trying to communicate.</p>\n"

              "text": "<p>When Ojiichan died, the Nasushiobara I knew and loved died with him. It wasn’t just his absence that changed the city, but the local government was also changed. It started pushing Gappei (mergers), a federally mandated program that amalgamated municipalities of decreasing population to cut national expenditures and strengthen local administration. Gappei in Nasushiobara took the form of “Land Readjustment” in 2005, where irregularly shaped lots were sliced and boxed into strictly regimented grids to improve public infrastructure, like roads and sewage systems. For the sake of fitting into a more “regular” grid, my grandparents’ house was lifted by a crane, dropped onto a rail track, and pulled to a location just five minutes away. Ctrl X, Ctrl V – home was quite literally cut and pasted into the Gappei grid, flattening over the existing grid as if thousands of memories and personal attachments didn&#8217;t already exist between those lines.</p>\n<p>Rural Japan’s municipal merger program dissolved Nasushiobara into surrounding neighborhoods in the name of “efficiency” and “growth.” I became witness to its rapid homogenization and so-called development; each year, I lost yet another element of the city that I loved. In 2007 I lost the vegetable gardens to perfectly paved roads; in 2008 I lost the rice fields to rows of identical apartments; in 2009 I lost the small local shops to mega-markets. We stopped walking on pebble pathways to street merchants to buy potato kurokke; we started driving on wide roads to chain supermarkets to buy the same things that I could buy in California. Nasushiobara’s identity, culture, and history was dissolved in a cookie cutter standardization that made for repetitive and auto-centric landscapes indistinguishable from everything nearby.</p>\n<p>The Japanese government sought to cut costs in a top-down, hasty displacement — in doing so, it cut corners and ultimately created spaces that are clones of schemes found everywhere. The loss of place in Nasushiobara helped me understand that location-based markers of human experience are precious and vastly important for fruitful connections to each other and our environment. Neighborhoods should be patterned with overlapping and interlocking community ties developed over time. It is easy to cut and paste seemingly simple solutions — yet these solutions are often simplistic reductions that create messier, more complicated problems. Development should not mean dispossession; efficiency should not mean erasure. We cannot simply press Ctrl Z to undo this process.</p>\n"

Much of her adolescence was spent in Denmark, which has one of the highest transnational adoption rates per capita. Nevertheless, it wasn’t until she returned to Korea in 2001 that she gained an opportunity to explore the complexity of the Korean diaspora through art. The 2004 Gathering was a historical event in which adoptees from around 15 countries met in the country for the first time; for many, it would be the first time that they would feel some common understanding among others who shared their respective rich experiences. Kaisen’s return to Korea became an impetus for her work that guided her throughout much of her adulthood.</p>\n<p>Kaisen’s practice spans over 15 years of research and documentation through film, a selection of which is now at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit through January 30, 2022. The exhibition features her 2010 narrative experimental film <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>The Woman, The Orphan, and the Tiger</em>,</span> made in collaboration with Guston Sondin-Kung, which follows three generations of women as they speak about their histories as transnational adoptees, military camptown sex workers, or former “comfort women,” culminating in a chorus of personal accounts that fights against the colonial amnesia that has erased their official histories.</p>\n<p>Like <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>The Woman, The Orphan, and the Tiger</em>,</span> many of Kaisen’s films on display focus on looking at Korea beyond border thinking. What does self-determination look like from a transnational standpoint? What have previous generations learned from each other that our generation should understand as we fight for reunification? Kaisen believes it is important to be modest about our activism and wander through our histories.</p>\n<p>Below is a conversation with Kaisen about the importance of patience in disentangling modern Korean history, and the process behind some of her most evocative filmic work.</p>\n"

              "text": "<p><strong>Lisa Kwon </strong>What motivates your work?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane Jin Kaisen</strong> I think mentally, it has to do with a sense of necessity and responsibility. I mean this in both a subjective and collective sense. I feel a commitment, somehow, to reflect on and understand and respond to the complexity of our times. There are certain themes that recur in my work about memory, translation, historical circumstances, diaspora, and gender issues.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa </strong>Was there a personal moment as a child or a Korean adoptee that made you feel personal ties to exploring memory and how history gets written and rewritten?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane </strong>In some ways, [becoming] an artist and [exploring] questions of transnational adoption coincided with my entering art school in the early 2000s. That was also the time I went to Korea and it was a moment of piecing together an understanding of my own subjectivity and also the larger histories and legacies that led to the process of transnational adoption from Korea to Western countries.</p>\n<p>In 2004, I co-founded an artist collective in Scandinavia called UFOlab, or Unidentified Foreign Object Laboratory with four other transnational adoptee women from Denmark and Sweden. It was one of the first collective artist groups of women of color in Scandinavia creating works together. This was also a moment when we were informed by the status of other artists and other social justice activists, scholars, somehow intersecting with Korea — not just transnational adoptees but also diasporic Koreans who began to return.</p>\n<p>2004 was also a historic year in Korea because it was the first time a large number of transnational adoptees returned to Korea at the same time for the International Adoptee Gathering. This was also when several politically informed groups formed: Adoptee Solidarity Korea (ASK) and Truth and Reconciliation for the Adoption Community of Korea (TRACK). I was involved in these activities in both Korea and Scandinavia; there was an early exhibition, <em>Rethinking Nordic Colonialism</em> that I took part in in Scandinavia together with anti-racist scholar and activist Tobias Hübinette, that dealt with the colonial amnesia of northern Europe. The colonial legacy of Scandinavia was not really talked about at the time, so [the work] shifted my understanding both of the context that I was living in, and also the context where I was studying art. These were some early formations that really led me to explore the history and modernity of Korea.</p>\n<p>I also studied in the U.S. afterward — first in New York, and then at UCLA — and it was a very different arts education than what I studied in Europe in terms of studying feminist and post-colonial Marxist theory, but also in terms of becoming involved in diasporic communities and communities of color in the States and understanding a different kind of history of civil rights movements in the U.S.</p>\n"

I was a part of this peak generation of adoptions from Korea that happened in the 1970s and 1980s under the military authoritarian governments during Korea’s rapid economic development. It’s also really particular to be adopted to Denmark because it’s the place that has one of the world’s highest number of Korean adoptees per capita. There were not many other minorities at the time when I grew up. It’s striking in that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong> There’s a strong resistance in your work against narratives that have been driven by colonial imperialism, and you also mentioned working with different activist groups. Do you also consider yourself an activist?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane </strong>I certainly have affinities [for] movements for social justice. I want to be more egalitarian while working with other groups in my work so in that sense, there is a strong commitment to [activism].</p>\n<p>I also think I should always be in solidarity. Something that I realize is that perhaps what I can do more is make a different kind of impact — a resonance through art. For me art has a lot to do with how our stories come to inform how we perceive reality and how we understand each other. I think art really has potential in shifting what are common narratives of representation forms, and somehow carving out alternative ways of understanding the reality in which we live. It’s sometimes a different kind of language from the more direct manner of activists, but I see them as related. Personally I believe I can say something different through artistic practice.</p>\n"

From filming about the Jeju Island massacre to relocation of the Koryo-saram…how did you find them?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through my practice I make individual works, but many of them relate to each other. Research from one project will build into another project, so they are all correlated. When I was working on </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Woman, The Orphan, and the Tiger</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I was researching 20th century Korean history and issues of militarization, and then I became curious about looking towards the history of Jeju because Jeju is where my birth family is from. That is how I came to engage much more deeply with the history of the Jeju Massacre. It’s also a particular place in Korean history, a significant event for understanding the definition of Korea and the Korean War. I got to work with those issues from 2010–2011 and stayed close with different participants in truth and reconciliation movements in Jeju since then. I think that many of my works are formed around conversations and participation with people. With Koryo-Saram (members of the Korean diaspora in post-Soviet states) I met a person from Kazakhstan, Alexandra Tsay, in Seoul who had a very interesting perspective about the different experiences of dislocation and different vantage points on the Korean Peninsula. I was curious about her experience and the experience of the community that she grew up with. I think this was a mutual kind of curiosity. She is one of the narrators in my recent film <em>Community of Parting</em> and in the film her voice is weaved together with many other voices of South Korean, North Korean and diasporic Korean women.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong> With the various work and research you’ve done through film, do you have an understanding of why these stories of resistance aren’t told more often? What is the difficulty with giving them more visibility?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think it has a lot to do with power. Certain institutions have catered to certain groups of people. Usually with the people who hold societal power, there can be an unwillingness to distribute that more evenly. It can also be because once you bring those topics of resistance and forms of militarization up, you also have to ask what kind of structures are supporting the forces that keep certain people in the systems of marginalization. It becomes this mirror of oppression of society, so it’s not always so comfortable for some to look into. Of course, I think it is very important and necessary, but it’s a big continual negotiation at the moment in so many places because sociodemographics are shifting, and people who have other kinds of stories to tell would like those to be audible. I think that is why sometimes there is not more visibility. It can feel threatening to some and can feel kind of difficult to share that power and space and privilege. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong> I imagine it takes a lot of patience that drives long-term conversations because of that.</p>\n<p><strong>Jane </strong>Yes. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe when I was younger I was more head-on, but I think over time I learned to proceed with a certain kind of patience and humbleness. For example, with some of the people who have worked on the Jeju Massacre for decades, working toward visibility is one thing, but it is also about: What kind of society do we want to live in? How can power be distributed in a more even way, without shifting power from one group to another? In that way I guess I obtained some humbleness from talking to some of these people over time. </span></p>\n"

What can we learn from the women behind historic resistance moments in Korea?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something that happens when people talk about stories of resistance is that sometimes it can be hard to know what previous generations used to think because that’s not included in official histories. So you have to kind of begin anew. I think there’s a really great importance to deeper historical understanding and recognition of what previous generations were also struggling for. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things I’ve been looking at is the fascinating history of the Jeju women divers and their anti-colonial resistance. They have worked under very intense, tough conditions not just physically and mentally, but also within a patriarchal structure. But they were able to create very strong ties to each other that were formulated around a different kind of socioeconomic society from society at large. It’s a codependency and co-reliance with a lot of trust when you go diving together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think I go back to many of their conversations now because we’re facing this climate catastrophe and some of the issues we’re facing really also have to do with the necessity of changing our mindset. Maybe something to be learned is this practice of humbleness towards your surroundings, nature, and other cohabitations, where you don’t take more than what you can afford in terms of farming the sea. Don’t expect too many resources. You have to let the sea and nature heal. I think this sort of way of being with others and the natural environment is something that is very important at this moment. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong> Particularly in Korea, collective memory has so much power against officially written history. Looking ahead, what can be done to advance self-determination in Korea?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a good question. I’m always a little bit wary about — specific to national self-determination — clearly recognizing how the Peninsula has been since the formation of North and South have been under such heavy influence and imposition from the United States, China, the Soviet Union and Japan. There is this necessity to disentangle from alliances and the mindset that militarism is predicated upon, but at the same time it is important to think about how that could be done in a way that doesn’t turn into nationalism and create new kinds of binaries and forms of exclusion. I’m curious about forms of collective memory that actually build affinities across borders, forms of radical solidarity and somehow speak to different regional alliances and different transnational and intergenerational alliances.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For MOCAD, while talking about transnational women delegations, I was thinking about these moments where forms of international solidarity across borders can be built. Our movements for self-determination can be configured around something else besides a national entity. That has been an impetus in thinking about how to do away with these forms of border thinking — not only removing the DMZ, but also the borders that are everywhere else in society, such as gender bias, racism, or class hierarchies.<br />\n</span></p>\n"

Especially because a lot of my work deals with actually connecting the different times and spaces, there’s something about the medium having a special ability to pull together these different layers. Also you can really work with several kinds of registers, like sensorial, performative, and cognitive registers. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Woman, The Orphan and the Tiger</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an experimental film that really oscillates between something that is more interview-based to something that is quite performative, poetic and multi-vocally driven.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think that film as a medium also has a relation to memory because film is essentially about time and a connection to lived experience. There’s something about the medium itself that carries an intrinsic potentiality for addressing questions of diasporic reality and how times and spaces are fragmented.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong> What keeps you in Copenhagen?</p>\n<p><strong>Jane </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At this moment I’m a professor at The School of Media Arts at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. It is a different kind of challenge to be teaching, and that is one of the reasons I stay. Something that I see while working with students is that it is related to what my generation was working towards in the early 2000s. That whole dialogue and discourse is in a different place now though. It’s not necessarily easier. In some ways it’s more difficult, or there are different kinds of challenges. But I can also see how the younger generation today is much more informed, has a much more elaborate language, and is much more connected than we were. It’s quite inspiring to observe that.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Lisa</strong> How did you land on &#8220;Parallax Conjunctures&#8221; as the name for your exhibition at MOCAD? It’s a very technical name.</p>\n<p><strong>Jane </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s quite technical, it’s kind of funny. I was thinking about my earlier work &#8220;</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apertures | Specters | Rifts&#8221;</span></em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and how I </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was curious about aperture referring to the eyes and sense of sight in an almost scientific way. I think about parallax in a similar sense. It has to do with the placement of your position and relation. You perceive [an object] differently from different positions, but the object is the same. I was thinking about that in relation to the DMZ. &#8220;</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apertures | Specters | Rifts&#8221;</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was based on the DMZ crossing and my travel to North and South Korea in 2015. I was dealing with this question of borders, so I think that’s how the title somehow came about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recognition of what you perceive has a lot to do with your position in relation to something in a way that is sort of an objective viewpoint. It is somehow between oneself and the object in mind. I think that was my experience of the border. It can be something that is extremely abstract to some, and to others, it can be something incredibly tangible, violent and visceral. </span></p>\n"

I treat Pure Person Press in the same manner. These releases are more a space for myself and the artists I work with to grow and understand ourselves. For each album, I work closely with the artist, getting to know their thoughts, philosophies, and musical styles intimately.  The goal for the album release process is to be more of a cathartic release than a physical one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am very proud to welcome our latest artist No Translation to the label. No Translation is Emma Palm, a Joshua Tree based musician who uses field recordings, vocals, and modular synths to create personal soundscapes. &#8220;</span><a href=\"https://no-translation.bandcamp.com/album/inner-distance?label=494512347&amp;tab=music\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inner Distance&#8221;</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is No Translation’s album debut on Pure Person Press. The album uses field recordings from both Emma’s life in Joshua Tree and her Mother’s life in Taiwan to create a healing space. The first time I heard this album, grief washed over me. It was immediate and soothing. This is meditative music, but in its bones there is a deeply restrained sense of longing: </span></p>\n",

I moved to Taiwan in direct response to my mother’s passing in 2018. My mother’s last words to me were over the phone: “Move to Taiwan.” I’ve always been a good kid. I moved to Taiwan within 3 months of her passing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I chose to release &#8220;Inner Distance&#8221; on November 22, 2021 &#8211; the three year anniversary of my mother’s death. I believe that even after someone dies, there are times when your spirits can yearn for each other so deeply that they can meet again. I believe that when I am thinking of my mother and she is thinking of me, even if we are unaware physically&#8230; we are somewhere together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are together on a gold morning at the top of a mountain in Kending. We are together in the dark night when I am alone in bed, a raw hole gnawing in my chest. We are together when I am with my sister, the two of us laughing at the past. We are together when I listen to music: an imagined future glowing bright.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This album is truly a gift for both Emma’s mother and mine: a new space where we can meet our mothers again. </span></p>\n"

              "text": "<p>More than a millennia before the 1850 sugar rush, Polynesian settlers formed Hawaii&#8217;s indigenous culture: fishing, farming and becoming the foundation for more than 527,000 kanaka maoli living today in the US.</p>\n<p>Between 1850-1900, thousands of laborers from China, Portugal, Japan, the Philippines, Korea, Puerto Rico and Okinawa migrated to Hawaii, the cluster of islands located nearly equidistant between North America and Asia. Chinese laborers were some of the first migrants to arrive, and were also some of the first to collectively create a middle class alongside Portuguese cowboys (who were granted citizenship, land, and higher positions on the basis of their European heritage).  Some of these workers (and, realistically, indentured servants), pushed on towards the mainland, but many stayed.</p>\n<p>Thus formed the melting pot of Hawaii, a place battling between sustaining Polynesian indigenous culture, developing a truly pan-Asian state, fighting the tourist economy&#8217;s ongoing gentrification and exploitation alongside the daunting course of nature, as the future of several of the islands are likely to be submerged in less than 50 years.</p>\n<p>This is why Hawaiians today, identifying with many aspects of Hawaii&#8217;s history, are now looking to find a balance between tradition, humanity and nature by noting the taste, smell and air of their homeland.</p>\n<p>Ty, Kapono and Hiro, the founders of a Hawaiian beauty brand Koa, returned to the islands during Covid, reflecting on their home. For them, it’s a place where they feel like they truly belong. It provides a sense of balance. Kapono, who is also part Hawaiian, reflects on the common saying ‘Living Pono’, which means to be balanced.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Living Pono is in the beauties of Hawaii– from the wisps of the warm ocean breeze to the crashing waves against monstrous mountains. From the beaming sun that warms the valleys to the pouring rain that blooms luscious green forests, these are just some of the Hawaiian adornments that come to mind when manifesting balance into Koa.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The equilibrium of Hawaiian cultural elements is what sustains their visions for their brand and ignites the passion for what they do.</p>\n<p>Below are some sensorial moments from the three friends.</p>\n",

She ventured out alone from Japan to the US in her early twenties, having picked up English by listening to American radio shows at night.

She is a tiger mom but it comes from a deeply loving place. She has a wry sense of humor and despite going through many, many hardships always steps forward with purpose. It has been a great pleasure to spend the last year living with her at home in Hawaii.</p>\n<p>– Hiro Shinn</p>\n",

For her, photography is used as a gesture of love. By carefully carrying the subject’s trust and vulnerability on her shoulders and into her lens,  she creates collective sanctuary capturing herself alongside the model. Both photographer and subject are exposed. She asks, how do we care for each other while creating and viewing art? </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <em>Family Album</em>, Ramona stages intimate moments with some of New York’s most distinct faces, contrasting their often high-production commercial identity with portraits among their personal spaces and family members. She chooses to de-tokenize, demystify and contextualize the POC artist’s identity. She wants the viewer to question if and why the appearance of POC bodies must make artwork and imagery inherently political.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below, FAR–NEAR interviews Ramona and her photographic companions on vulnerability, what they keep close and how they approach the familiar.</span></p>\n",

How are they part of your life?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Ramona</strong> My parents and grandparents live in Guangzhou, China. I grew up with my parents and grandparents. When I was in kindergarten and elementary school, my grandma and grandpa would walk me to school in the morning and pick me up after school. I’d play badminton in the morning with my grandma before school. My dad cooks really good Sichuan food for us while my mom rarely goes into the kitchen. After I came to the U.S, my mom likes to send me random photos of her crochet bags that she makes when she’s bored.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Emily</strong> My immediate family lives on Oahu, where I was born and raised, and in Hong Kong where my mother was born. I usually see them once or twice a year and talk with them on the phone, but it’s difficult because of the time difference. My mom likes sending me emails and photos of clothing she tries on at the mall and my dad sends me Facebook messages with photos of his lunch, sunsets and dogs, usually without captions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My grandparents on my mom’s side live in Hong Kong and own a store that makes children’s school uniforms. My grandfather is 93 and still goes to work every morning. He and my grandmother have been married for 60 years and eat at the same dim sum restaurant for lunch everyday. I haven’t seen them in years but my grandma always sends me handwritten cards on my birthday and printed photos of her and my grandfather all dressed up with their friends having fancy dinners together. They always look very classy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Angelica</strong> My family is my parents, siblings, countless aunties, uncles, cousins, cousins, cousins. But it’s also anyone who I can emotionally relate with, be myself with, supports me and in the end who I would do anything for and vice versa. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Wenhao</strong> My mother, Mingxia. Her influence is different at different stages of my life. currently, in my early 20s, she is teaching me the most and feeling the most present. I talk to her about almost anything except for romantic relationships. I think its fine that she isn’t apart of every aspect of my life, I have friends that can support me in those spaces.</span></p>\n"

              "text": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>FAR–NEAR</strong> People often say coworkers, friends and such are “like family,” do you believe this? What does this mean to you?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Ramona</strong> I believe in the idea of a chosen family and I think family can be a group of people that I feel comfortable and connected with. Because I’m usually working as a model and photographer, most of the time my coworkers are people that I only meet a few times on set, and sometimes we end up being friends. Almost all of the Asian models that I photographed in this series are from other shoots that we did together. When I see another Asian person on set, I somehow feel the urge to try to connect with them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Emily</strong> This might be cynical but my first thought is no. I feel like work relationships, at the end of the day, are fueled by money, so no matter how much you enjoy someone’s company within that structure, it still rests on the condition that this relationship is profitable and helps someone make money. But I guess you could argue that people might start off as coworkers and become genuine friends, or that money and transactional relationships also play a role in actual family relationships and even friendships too, so maybe it all just depends. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think friends can definitely be like family. In many ways I feel more socially accepted and understood by my friends in the city than I do around my immediate family. There is something very special about the idea of a family that you can actively choose and create for yourself with people who you actually want to have in your life. I like the idea of choosing people to be in your family because you love them, rather than just loving someone because they happen to be in your family and you’re supposed to.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Angelica</strong> Absolutely. Family is any community that you can relate with, feel supported by, and makes you feel safe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Kevin</strong> I think it&#8217;s easier to have a more genuine connection with people who grew up in the same generation and culture as us.  Our biological families may be from a different generation and may have even grown up in a different country which can make it harder to connect with them.  I think deep love and a strong bond are basic ingredients for referring to someone as your family outside of the biological context.</span></p>\n"

What is your caring language?</p>\n<p><strong>Ramona</strong> For me empathy and company are two big parts of showing care, and it should never be just a one time thing. I think caring requires constant and consistent thoughts, gestures and effort. I like to spend time with people I love even if we are doing nothing together. I try to be present whenever they need help and support.</p>\n<p><strong>Emily</strong> I think my caring language is a combination of emotional and practical. Thanks to my emotionally repressed Asian upbringing, I tend to be rather shy about expressing care very directly and verbally and am more comfortable showing it through nonverbal acts like helping someone with practical things… doing someone a favor, buying them dinner or giving gifts. But I’m trying to be better about showing care through language because I think it’s important. I feel very cared for whenever someone invites me over and cooks for me. There’s something that feels very warm and maternal that I really love.</p>\n<p><strong>Angelica</strong> I recognize care as doing what you can to make sure your loved one is happy and healthy. As an empath, I find my strong suit is being able to help through supportive words and an open heart.</p>\n<p><strong>Wenhao</strong> I feel most comfortable showing my care for those who have done the same for me. Caring for someone is changing and being fluid for them. Every person needs different things, so in order to care for them, I try to be receptive and look for what they specifically need.</p>\n<p><strong>Sam</strong> To me, showing you care is rooted in acts of kindness, words of affirmation, and quality time. I take that Five Love Languages quiz almost every month (haha), and those are usually my top three. The people I love will go out of their way to do small things to help me, tell me that everything is going to be ok, etc. So that&#8217;s shaped the way I care for others as well. I suppose my caring language is a combination of all three. I try my best to support those that I love by mirroring the care they give me.</p>\n"

              "text": "<p><strong>FAR–NEAR</strong> The word “familiar” derives from the word family. It is something that feels immediately intimate, recognizable or known to you. How do you think the art, fashion and cultural industries make Asian individuals and culture feel familiar? What do they make unfamiliar?</p>\n<p><strong>Ramona</strong> As an Asian living in the US for 8 years, I always have this subtle feeling of being in between things. I do not share a similar experience of growing up in the US with most Asian Americans and I’m comfortably identified with Chinese culture, but at the same time I have been living away from home for a long time. It is still surprising, confusing and shocking sometimes for me to see how certain Asian culture is represented in the western media in the current days. One of the most frequent feelings I have about Asian culture here is that people make Asian culture familiar by immediately simplifying it into a one dimensional merchandise, product, and brand. Such as Hello Kitty, bubble tea, kungfu, Wong Kar-Wai…&#8230;I have also had experience on set where multiple asian models were cast as a single package &#8211; they were intentionally chosen for their similar looking “Asian” face feature and were placed into the scene almost like props. The nuances and individual stories about asian culture were something that became unfamiliar and unheard.</p>\n<p><strong>Emily</strong> I feel like there’s an interesting divide between certain Asian individuals and parts of Asian culture that are very familiar and well-loved, and others that don’t. Cultural products like Pokemon, Anime, Bubble Tea, Chinese takeout, Miyazaki films, Muji and Uniqlo, or shows like Terrace House, all feel like familiar and mainstream things that almost everyone knows, or grew up with. Despite that, I don’t feel like there is the same level of familiarity with or excitement around Asian individuals for most people.<br />\nEven though there’s a small handful of media figures like Sandra Oh, Ali Wong or Lucy Liu who people might recognize and feel a sense of familiarity with, I feel like the majority of Asian people still carry the impression of being very foreign and unfamiliar. I think a lot of cultural representation still paints Asian people as strange, mysterious, unemotional, silent or foreign and robotic. I feel like even the media that is trying to have more Asian representation either ignores their character or actor’s Asian-ness entirely, in attempt at making them more familiar to a mainstream audience, or reduces them to their ethnicity and Asianness, thereby making them feel one-dimensional and even harder to relate to on a deeper and more intimate level.</p>\n<p>Even the ways a lot of Asian people are styled in fashion or photography I think contributes to these larger impressions of unfamiliarity. I’ve done multiple shoots where I’ve been stylized identically as at least one other Asian female in the shoot, I guess because of this kind of “twin aesthetic” that seems to be really popular, and while I can see the aesthetic appeal of it and believe it was probably unintentional, I also feel like that’s one example of the kind of imagery that can easily and subtly feed into this impression of Asian people all being identical and indistinguishable from one another.</p>\n<p><strong>Angelica</strong> When they recognize our stories and our hardships. When they include representation on screen and off screen. But when it’s an uneducated white person profiting off Asian culture, that’s not familiar.</p>\n<p><strong>Sam</strong> I think often times these industries make Asians feel &#8220;othered&#8221; and unrepresented. I regularly find myself feeling as if I&#8217;m navigating an unfamiliar space with not much representation or relation to my peers. However, I find a huge amount of comfort in the reality that there are Asian creatives and individuals that exist in these spaces (even if I&#8217;m not aware of them). When I get the opportunity to discover or build a connection with these people, that feeling of familiarity and warmth comes back.</p>\n"

In it, individuals of all ages pass through limbo and are asked to choose one memory from their life to bring with them into the afterlife. Many choose quiet, intimate moments over the spectacular. If you could keep one memory what would yours be?</p>\n<p><strong>Ramona</strong> The memory of walking home with grandma from school everyday. When I was in elementary school, my grandma would come with a bag of snacks (chicken wings, eggs, buns……) waiting for me at the school gate everyday, and we would walk to the bus stop and take a bus home. It does not sound like anything dramatic and special, but the feeling that there’s always someone waiting and caring for me stayed in my heart. It was a memory that makes me feel less lonely when I’m alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Emily</strong> There’s this memory I have of the night I got to shoot with the photographer Ren Hang on a beach in California the summer after my sophomore year in college. I snuck out of the house where I was staying in the middle of the night and got into this old beat up car with a broken taillight with a bunch of beautiful Asian kids around my age who I had never met before with Ren in the front seat, and we drove down to the seaside while nostalgic Canto Pop played in the car speakers. All of us stripped down naked on the sand and climbed on these large cliffs and giant black rocks, laying on top of each other and contorting our bodies into strange shapes as Ren skipped around on the sand barefoot with his camera like an excited child with a new toy and took photos. The moon was really bright and the water was super cold but I honestly didn’t even care and felt like a wild animal in its natural state. I don’t think I’ve ever felt more alive and connected to nature or my body than I did that night. I just remember feeling so lucky and grateful for being Asian and exactly who I was at that moment in time. I don’t think I’ll ever experience that kind of magic ever again but I think about it all the time and want to keep chasing that feeling forever.</p>\n<p><strong>Angelica</strong> That’s… too hard. A compilation memory of me hugging everyone I love.</p>\n<p><strong>Kevin</strong> The taste of mango.</p>\n<p><strong>Sam</strong> When all of my family members would come over to celebrate my birthday. We&#8217;d play video games together, eat Burmese food, and laugh a lot.</p>\n"

What do you listen to?</p>\n<p><strong>Tomi Kono</strong> I listen to YouTube while making wigs: Japanese comedy, historical documentaries, music, etc. I like listening to Jazz. Bill Evans in the morning.</p>\n<p><strong>Sayaka Maruyama</strong> Almost unconsciously but I tend to think about the balance: Size, colors and composition, etc. Recently I&#8217;m listening to Rosalia, Tokischca, Sevdaliza, Os Tincoas (Deixa A Gira Girar)</p>\n<p><strong>Chihiro Gompei </strong>I don&#8217;t really think anything while I work with my hands. Although historical research is crucial to my practice, I have to leave all knowledge behind to make things. Making is like having an intuitive dialogue with materials, colours, volumes and textures, so to the second question, I listen to materials that speak languages I never fully understand. But more practically, I listen to Nina Simone, Erykah Badu, Missy Elliot and Gacharic Spin these days.</p>\n<p><strong>Laura Chautin </strong>When I work on my paintings I am usually off in another world. I think about places that I’d like to go or places from my past that I’d like to revisit. A lot of my landscapes are pulled from memories of England.<br />\nWhen I’m in the act of making ceramics I am quite focused on the process- which is coiling the clay into a form. It’s meditative because I have to be incredibly present with my mind and hands.</p>\n<p>When I’m at home working I’ll have the radio on or I’m listening to a playlist Masami has made (mostly old school J pop.) At the ceramic studio I’m not listening to anything, it’s quite chatty and collaborative there so I’m talking to friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Upa</strong> I don&#8217;t think about anything when I work, just follow the thoughts. Usually I really need to be quiet, sometimes I do listen to podcast and music, “The  Rocky Horror Picture Show” is my favorite album recently.</p>\n<div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">\n<div dir=\"auto\"><strong>Hana Yagi</strong> When I work,  I&#8217;m thinking about how to connect the reality and fantasy. I listen to the radio.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

For this project, we worked closely with a composer to build the score of the film first, which is constructed with Japanese words that act as onomatopoeias. It is Anna&#8217;s voice saying these words that become the verbal foundation of her personal ephemeral experience. Doki Doki, although shared in 2D, is meant to feel tactile for the viewer, inviting the audience to lean towards their senses.</p>\n",

The team came together at the height of Covid-19 to challenge what is considered fashionable in Hong Kong through art. Their aim: to transform something deemed less desired in the consumer-driven industry into something beautiful and heavenly. Here, CHILI expresses the bittersweet freedom of subversive beauty and the heights you can reach when you take chances and have faith.</p>\n",

Having been born and raised in Flanders and separated from my Chinese relatives, this fabric provided a means for me to savor family ties. I awakened each morning, as my kin did, in a bed covered by Double Horse silk quilts; enveloped by their soft warmth. Growing up interracial in a different culture, a different climate, the presence of shared objects created a sense of communality. Part of our day-to-day life, they are easily overlooked, but become part of a collective experience. The oolong tea boxes, the rice cooker in the kitchen, ginseng in whiskey bottles — elements not part of the typical Western household were staples in my childhood home, which housed a mixture of cultural elements. This sort of cultural melange comprises the DNA of each diasporic abode, and becomes a part of a cultural geography and identity — a visual landscape of belonging and being.</p>\n",

The material refracted photons from every angle due to its prismatic structure, creating a shimmering appearance. The way the fabric flows and drapes has been a perennial source of fascination for me. Part of playtime consisted of fashioning dolls’ dresses with silk fabric swatches, coming to understand the material’s versatility. When it came to selecting presents for visits to my kindergarten friends, my go-to choice would be the Chinese mementos stored in the closet. I would open the doors — the scent of mothballs unfurling — and uncover the selection of white silk hand-painted scarves. The detailed craftsmanship in each piece filled me with happiness and a sense of wonder. Being able to share part of my heritage through a gift was joyous.</p>\n<p>Cold autumnal winds in western Europe would be buffered by navy Double Horse silk wadded jackets. I still have the jackets on hangers on display, some with patches of faded colors due to exposure to direct sunlight — the discoloration forming a symbolic marker of time. Over the years, fashion has been an instinctive way to express myself, to project how I want to feel — a visual and tactile mode of non-verbal communication that connects a family separated by language.</p>\n"

              "text": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking Chinese without being able to speak it is a not uncommon experience among members of the Chinese diaspora in Western countries. Since infancy, I would hear the short daily calls from my father to his relatives </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the melodic flow of Cantonese in the background </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> without understanding the content of the stream of words. As a child I noticed how, after the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People’s Republic of China, my relatives’ habit of speaking English slowly dissipated. Our conversations became less fluent, the search for words more conspicuous, rendering a growing sense of distance in communication during these long-distance calls. The inability to communicate through language with my relatives abroad was and continues to be a source of pain. Anti-Chinese sentiment where I grew up extended to how the Cantonese language was welcomed. This would manifest in the form of negative comments about China, sly remarks about Asiatic features and condescending jokes about phonology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A common comeback in Dutch is “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dat is Chinees voor mij,</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” literally meaning “That is Chinese to me;” the English equivalent to the saying “Double Dutch.” The double irony of these idioms is not lost on me. Speaking Cantonese or Mandarin in a Dutch-speaking region would have added to being seen as an Other. Sadly, this remains the case today, with Sinophobia on the rise. Unfavorable views of China have exploded in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. I remember how on the tram or train during the start of the pandemic, fellow people of Asian descent would receive suspicious and unwelcoming stares. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the pandemic it has been impossible to visit my family overseas. This separation highlights the space between us. Distance prevents the sharing of interpersonal space, of touch. The many missed family memories and lost days of communality, which inevitably occur when living on different continents, accumulate over the years. The silent side-by-side imperceptible shifts in habits, the mundane little joys all move along the axis of time, mounting to seismic proportions to be unveiled at each reunion. What is lost lies in the absence of expressions, behavioural cues and shared space. Proxemic and haptic behaviour form vital components in non-verbal communication. Their absence leaves a void in the visual and tactile culture of daily social experiences and interactions. Trying to find alternatives to replace conventional interpersonal communication has led me to contemplate the role silk has played in bridging gaps created by distance, cultural and language barriers. The haptic immediacy of the soft fabric lends an actuality to being “in touch.”</span></p>\n"

Even though we could not communicate well with words, we found ways to engage in a visual dialogue. This being one of them. An undeniable expression of pride beamed across her face. My grandmother, captured on celluloid as a young woman in her qipao, emanated a timeless elegance. Her act of sharing a memory of keystone moments in her life arched the distance which prevented us from experiencing many of those moments in real time. Fast forward five years, my father surprised me with my own qipao by taking me on a visit to a tailor in the Panyu district of Guangzhou. Feeling like a kid in a sartorial candy store, being spoiled for choice. I finally settled on a silk fabric laced with sprigs of plum blossom embroidery. Traditionally the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ume</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blossom represents perseverance and hope, often seen as the harbingers of spring. The whole process </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from sketching a design to selecting together with the tailor the exact piping and pankous </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a memory I will always cherish. Being able to share it with my father, the talented tailors, and the lovely patron who was in for an alteration, enriches the garment with a personal history of interpersonal interactions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My last trips to Hong Kong were hallmarked by hospital visits to see my grandmother, after her health suddenly deteriorated. In the care home, at the hospital, or during family dinners at my grandmother’s flat, the old photo albums offered a welcome distraction from her pain. Their nostalgia provided a small comfort. My grandmother’s face would light up when showing her family snapshots </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a means of connection and escapism, especially during a time when her mobility was compromised. Seeing these snapshots for the first time, it was as if I was uncovering little puzzle pieces of my genealogy, witnessing the special occasions, travel outings, and get-togethers throughout the years. They offered insight into the individual stylistic flairs of my relatives and showcased how their fashion sense evolved throughout the years. Decades later, their outfits still look evergreen. Some of my favorite looks include my grandfather’s high-waisted slacks, combined with a white vest and a loosely tucked in silk shirt or my grandmother’s patterned qipao collection.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the empty afternoons between the noon and evening visiting hours of the Tung Wah hospital, my aunt and I would stroll the meandering streets of Sheung Wah, taking our lunch breaks amidst the foliage of Hollywood Road park, scouring the stores for different teas to take back home together. She would tell stories of how my father at my age would often peruse the antique shops in the neighborhood. Walking along Po Hing Fong, beside Blake Garden with its ancient Chinese Banyan trees, we would wander along the bohemian cafes and art galleries. A favorite haunt was a silk shop with contemporary printed sheer designs. </span></p>\n"

For New York designers, who are an eclectic mix of nationalities, style and approach, looking inward for artistry sometimes means revisiting places close to home, or a knowledge of the lack thereof. For them, this modern world is an ever changing landscape, one that builds and deconstructs – a constant battle between creating new things and selectively producing with an awareness of the environment around them, and their effects on it. Below, FAR–NEAR speaks to a few of the designers from photographer Eli Wirija and stylist Ashly Tsao&#8217;s exploration on the current interpretations of vernacular fashion.</p>\n",

From the history shared with me, my grandparents grew up in Vietnam under French colonisation; my grandmothers were both born in Vietnam but their ancestral ties are less clear while both my grandfathers were Hokkien people from the mountainous and coastal Fujian province before they fleed to Vietnam due to the Chinese Civil War and Second Sino-Japanese War. Fujian, once known as Minyue before assimilation by the Han Chinese, is the province that Taiwan was once incorporated with and then colonized by Japan after the First Sino-Japanese War.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Raul Solis</em> </strong>I&#8217;m constantly looking back in order to learn how to move forward.

They arrive in foam boxes wrestling, spilling out their own life source in desperation. Goldfish watch from their plastic bag balconies, pacing around like concubines in their Hanfu. Amongst the chaos, hands in gloves like midwives before deliverance. Knives glide up and down releasing scales in sprays of white and silver confetti. The climax of an ending. Blood follows, trailing down their bodies. A shower head clears the act, a crimson river runs down the drain. They had swum freely like gods, only to spill their guts on the day of judgement. Honesty never looked so gruesome. They will take their final resting place on our dinner plates &#8211; dressed in whatever satisfies us. Their bones will be gifted to our pets. Remembrance won’t take place, it never does, as we will journey the very next day to pick another. After all, we have become the gods.</p>\n"

My jade bracelet snapped when I left him and moved to England. My grandma said this is an omen when something bad is going to happen. The jade took the damage, not me.

Her three eggs hatched into three children, all who became farmers for her business. “This was better than the rice fields,” she would squawk. I remember the day she told me, I curled under her wing. Safety. I miss that feeling.  She never did fly, but I’m learning for her. A year later her feathers began to fall. One by one they littered our living room floor. Two years later her skin was cold. A flightless bird. She never had a Chinese funeral. I always wondered what it would have been like.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Not intentionally, but I had to tell him the truth. Now I was on my knees, picking up tiny shards with my chopstick fingers. Fiddling with pieces like those westerners I’d serve at my his restaurant. Nervously I looked up and there he was, holding a broom. Whereas my mother would have hit me, my father herded me aside like some shepherd. He began to clean my mess. My siblings watched from the stairs, sauntering around the pieces, dodging injury. Adult arms glided down like necks of cranes. Their beak-like fingers reaching the surface of the kitchen floor, effortlessly plucking the last of the shards. I pushed myself against the wall with my childlike shame and watched my family clean as I tucked away my bloodied toes.</p>\n"

The funeral had been a long procedure. I could still smell the smoke and hear the chanting ringing in my ears days later. I had never seen so many of us return at once. The elders  wept and gripped onto their father’s coffin. My stoic grandmother revealed everything during those three days. But she was calm tonight. Then it happened, the dogs erupting with their barks. Our phones buzzed with excitement, messages from cousins traveling throughout the village. Did you hear that? what&#8217;s going on ? Who’s here? Then silence.</p>\n<p>The next morning, we came in and everything was as it was. The food was undisturbed, not even a fly dared to touch what was his. She sat peacefully on her bed.

To quote June Jordan, in a time when the powerful few tries to keep people forever inaudible and unknown to one another, Love in The Time Of aims get to know those around us, celebrating our differences and contradictions to reveal the importance of existing for something, not just against.</p>\n<p>This series features a photo diary by Colum Bowyer and Acudus Aranyian, an interracial queer couple who originally met in Taipei in 2017, now living in Bushwick, New York since the early onset of the pandemic. Sharing words with FAR–NEAR, their story explores a long distance love turned marriage turned quarantine corner, accompanied with a selected poem by Kira Wei-Hsin Jacobson (許維昕), a conceptually oriented artist &amp; poet based in Taipei and San Diego. Kira’s poem is one that reminds the couple of the time they began getting to know each other and expanding their newly intertwined lives in Taipei. Through language, Kira works to honor the complexity and ambiguity of identity. By reflecting on the body as a cluster of intensities that changes and grows they strive to disrupt the dualisms and binaries that limit our perceptions. Their writing has been featured in Impossible Archetype, Bitter Melon’s stay home diary,  &#8216;Forms of Formosa&#8217; published by TWG press, and on Radio Taiwan International&#8217;s Book of Odes.</p>\n",

I was traveling at the time, and we matched on Tinder. I remember we chatted a little bit after we matched, but I wasn’t in Taipei long before heading south to Nantou to work at a small eco-village. After I returned to Taipei, we arranged to meet at the record store where he worked on one of my last nights in Taiwan. A friend and I went shopping before I went to meet him — I was determined to get some nail polish (and I did! Some light pink that I kept for a long time after). I took the train to Acudus’s store, and immediately hid in the bathroom as soon as I got there. I was so nervous!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Acudus Aranyian</strong></em> There was another group of friends of mine in the store too and they convinced Colum to come with us to a cafe bar that I liked going to called Le Chat. My English was even worse than now, it was quite awkward. On the day we met, I was also having an argument with my family. The previous months had been pretty depressing because of the conditions of the world around me and several issues that had happened to me in that year.</p>\n</div>\n"

Because he only had three days left in Taiwan, I kind of kidnapped him from his hostel. We were just hanging out in my apartment in Tamsui the whole time. I remember we talked, and cried together, watched movies, and talked, cuddled together, and cried. That was my first impression of him: he was pure, I was truly lucky to get to spend time with him. And I still feel lucky now.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Colum</strong></em> I think we both have a quiet and gentle nature. We got back to his neighborhood in Tamsui and bought some stinky tofu from a roadside stand before heading up to his studio apartment. We sat on his balcony and watched Girlfriend Boyfriend. We spent the next 36 hours together — we hung out with his friends and my friend I’d met the previous week in Nantou. Everything we did that day was imbued with beauty; I could sense the world opening up in a way I hadn’t for a long time. On the night before my flight, we slept on his floor because his best friend was in the bed. There was a moment when I thought I would be sleeping on the floor alone; I felt so relieved when he set up to sleep next to me. He walked me to the bus stop – the R27 to Tamsui MRT station. It’s insane to think that that could’ve been the end. After I left Taiwan, I felt so heartbroken — I cried a lot on the train to the airport and in my windowless hostel room in Chungking Mansions. I felt an immense loss, even though we had known each other for less than two days. It seemed impossible to me that I had met someone like him only to have it end so abruptly and permanently. I’d really never met anyone like him. After a few days in Hong Kong, I realized there was no option other than scrapping my plans and returning to Taipei.</p>\n<p>I worked at a hostel in Dongmen and we spent most of our free time together. I fell in love with him during those weeks. Facing another departure, I again felt that the situation was impossible and unfair. There was so much uncertainty and sadness when I went back to Virginia. We talked on the phone for hours at a time – sometimes we didn’t talk, but just had the connection open while we lived our separate day/night/day. It wasn’t long before I decided to go back to Taiwan, this time to make a home and see where it would take us.</p>\n</div>\n"

              "text": "<div>\n<p><em><strong>Vivien</strong></em> Tell me about your favorite moments living in Taiwan together, what your life looked like there.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Colum</strong></em> I’d never lived in a big city before, so moving to Taipei was really exciting for me. The first month there was so sweet. It was August and extremely hot. I stayed at Acudus’s apartment while I looked for my own place, and, for the first few weeks, rarely ventured out on my own. I felt so shy about living in a country where I didn’t speak the language and didn’t even know how to order food. It was difficult, and I had no idea what I was doing, but I was so, so happy. Every long hot day felt precious. I remember smoking on the balcony in the late afternoon, listening to the jingle of the garbage trucks making their rounds in Tamsui, and looking at the high-rise buildings against a blinding sinking sun. I remember buying mangoes from the sunset market down the hill from the apartment. My whole world had shrunk into Acudus’s room, the streets around Tamkang University, and the paths along the Tamsui River. By the end of the month, I’d found an apartment and a job and the world came rushing in with it.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Acudus</strong></em> We used to go on rooftops a lot, especially the one we love the most near Guting station. We liked to get snacks and cans of Taiwan beer from the FamilyMart downstairs before walking confidently into the building and past the security guard, like we belonged, even though we didn’t live there. We took off our clothes and danced with friends or just lay up there and watched the sky. Our rooftops stretched from Tamsui and Guting to our new neighborhood in Zhonghe. These roofs brought me the best moments I had in Taipei. Life was beautiful there even though I was depressed all the time. I had to rely on some medication, and I also worked hard to avoid military service. After I dropped out from school, I quit my job at the record store. I encountered more racists throughout my job hunt. Until living these uncomfortable experiences for myself, I didn’t really realize that being indigenous in Taiwan meant I had to face all these problems. So I kind of didn’t have a stable job during my last year in Taipei. I spent more time focusing on photography – documenting daytime protests (for Marriage Equality and Transitional Justice for Indigenous Taiwanese) and queer nightlife in the city. Korner was gone after mid-2018, but then there were more techno venues blooming all over the city.</p>\n<p>We protested on Qingdao East Road outside of the Legislative Yuan. On the day the Constitutional Court announced the decision that prohibiting same-sex marriage is unconstitutional, I was wearing traditional Paiwan clothing that my grandmother made for me. We cried in relief once on that day, and cried again on the day after the referendum in 2018 showed most Taiwanese were anti LGBTQIA+. Even though love won at the end (same-sex marriage in Taiwan became legal on 24 May 2019), we got the right we need, and our government seemed like it did a great job throughout the ongoing pandemic, I’m sure there are still a lot of issues we need to focus on and take care of now and in the future.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Colum</strong></em> One thing I really love about Taipei is how accessible nature is. The whole city is surrounded by mountains and forest and the ocean is just to the north. There was this beach, Shalun Beach, where we would go camping with friends. We’d gather a lot of firewood — from the woods behind the dunes or from the broken-down bamboo windbreak fence — and make a big fire. The woods between the road and the beachfront were a well-known cruising area for gay men. Condom wrappers strewn over the leaflitter and pine needles. There was something lawless about those nights on the beach, about fiercely dragging tree limbs across the sand and stripping the dilapidated fence, about wondering if passengers on low-flying arrivals to Taoyuan airport could see our flames. Acudus was always the DJ and we would all dance. Those are some of my favorite memories.</p>\n</div>\n"

Then, only a few weeks later, we canceled everything. It was a blow for us. We had a comfortable life in Crozet and got to watch our niece grow and celebrate her first birthday. But while we were very connected with family, we were disconnected from the rest of the world. While I had a job I loved, we both felt that our lives were on hold in a sense. Still, I consider us lucky that we could stay in Virginia through those early days of the outbreak in the US. I kept working and life carried on. Still there was a growing feeling that we needed to push ourselves out, as soon as it felt reasonable to do so. That moment came at the end of May, but it’s debatable whether it was a reasonable time or not.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Acudus</strong></em> It was interesting when we moved here in June. People were still clapping on the streets or from the windows at 07:00 PM every day. Protests for Black lives were happening all across New York. And then there was a curfew in New York City, it was crazy! I finally understood how it was like in Taiwan during martial law before I was born (I’m sure there were still a lot of differences). We were looking for jobs when few businesses were open. Meanwhile, we were back on the streets to protest. It was amazing to see people stand on the streets to talk about racism in America, which is still hard to bring up and discuss in most countries in Asia.</p>\n</div>\n"

Especially when he’s asleep, just to look at him and touch his hair, I can’t really find a way to express the feeling of it. But it can always surprise me about how crazy it is.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Colum</strong></em> We make meals for each other, and Acudus has a way of making even a simple meal like grilled cheese and salad feel like a whole gorgeous experience. Our bedroom holds so much love and so many memories. It’s a foundation. I look forward to meeting more people and to living a more vibrant life when we can all revel together again.</p>\n</div>\n"

              "text": "<div>\n<p><em><strong>Vivien</strong></em> What are your favorite qualities about each other? And the least favorite?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Colum</strong></em> Acudus is one of the most emotionally intelligent people I’ve ever met. He is really perceptive to how those around him are feeling. When talking about how he is feeling, he always takes his time and uses deliberate language – he’s so in touch with himself. He’s also really thoughtful and considerate. Sometimes I can be careless or a little tactless, and his honesty and consideration balances me out and reminds me of how I can be better. Being so emotionally in tune comes with challenges, and his tendency to shut down when he is upset or sad can really throw me. There’s a switch and he can become inaccessible and unreadable to me, which I now know is a time when I can only give him space without withholding affection or attention or reacting defensively.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Acudus</strong></em> He’s good at planning long-term strategies; and I’m not. He seems born with this ability. I’m not joking. If you could see him planning stuff and see how he leads me working on our plans, you’d understand why it’s one of my favorite qualities about him. But when we’re talking about short-term stuff or need to make a decision immediately – this situation is my least favorite. Most of the time he can’t even tell left and right (same with east and west). The good thing is that we have opposite abilities about making short/long term plans. I know what to eat for dinner tonight, and he knows when to visit Taiwan together next time.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Colum</strong></em> Acudus has little tolerance for bullshit or disingenuousness. He’s not one for insincere small talk or fakeness – he simply doesn’t make time for fake or self-serving people. I think this has its strengths but also its pitfalls. Cutting through the bullshit is extremely important and refreshing; but it can sometimes be limiting, I think. It could perhaps cut off friendships or collaboration before they have a chance to develop past a sort of bantering, superficial level. Sometimes you have to put up with a little bit of that to get to something deeper. Still, recognizing fake-acting people is invaluable and I always pay attention to how he feels about someone, because he is more often right than wrong when it comes to judging character.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Acudus</strong></em> The most important quality about Colum that I like is that he still has that kind, pure, and soft heart. Even after all the arguments we had and how much time has passed. As long as the smell behind his neck is still the same, he’s always pure in my mind.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Colum</strong></em> There’s so much I adore about Acudus. He has impeccable music taste and an excellent sense of style. He’s a talented photographer. He’s curious about the world and the lives of other people. He appreciates comfort. He is clean and organized (and puts up with me when I am unorganized). He likes singing and lip-syncing Rihanna songs while wearing a wig and bathrobe in our living room. Acudus also always knows when it’s time to leave the party! Something I still haven’t learned.</p>\n</div>\n"

I wasn’t expecting to have anything like what we have before I met him. I didn’t know I’d decide to keep living before I met him. He lit a little hope on the first night we met when we were having stinky tofu and watching Gf*Bf on the balcony of my apartment in Tamsui. After two years, we made a goal to move out of Taiwan to start a new life. Now we’re here, and the hope is still there when he’s holding my hand. We both put our devotion to this hope, wishing for a better future for both of us. And there will be a day when we think maybe it’s time to move back to Taiwan.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Colum</strong></em> Beyond commitment, I think devotion in love and relationships means always seeking to learn more about the other person. We are all so deep and complicated, especially in ways that aren’t visible or readily shared. As individuals, no one can ever know us as we know ourselves, just as we can never see ourselves as others see us. Devotion, in part, means coming from a place where you understand that you can’t know everything about your partner and that it’s ok. It’s only when we stop seeking understanding and start holding fast to a fixed idea that devotion will decay. My devotion to Acudus is grounded in loving and honoring all of his person and soul, even those that I can’t see or that I may dislike or disagree with.</p>\n</div>\n"

Similarly, &#8220;Recite&#8221; also reflects my current self. Since the theme of the album relates to what I created 20 years ago, the songs start off as a continuation of where I was 20 years ago. It gradually develops and the chants of &#8220;Heart Sutra&#8221; at the end reflect my current state of mind.</p>\n<h4><em>《單純的人》這首歌，說的是我當下的心情，「recite」 也是用當下的我來創作，既然這張專輯的主題跟20年前相關，我所唱的內容是跟20年前是連結的，最後轉到唱誦《心經》是我現在的狀態。</em></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Angela</strong></em> What were your different states of mind or different processes when writing “A Pure Person” vs “Recite”?</p>\n<h4><em>當您在寫作念和單純的人時您有有什麼不同的心態和不同的寫作過程？</em></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Lim</strong></em> &#8220;A Pure Person&#8221; was written in 2000, when I had just established my studio in Taipei. Three people were involved with the composition, and the mixdown was completed by another mixer. At that time, I was still mentally exploring the process. &#8220;Recite&#8221; was recorded in my studio in Taichung and I created it alone, from beginning to end. Originally a friend was helping with the mix, but in the end I chose to go with my own version. I had a relatively clear state of mind when I wrote this song.</p>\n<h4><em>《單純的人》2000年我剛在台北成立工作室，有三個人參與編曲，有一個混音師mixdown，那時心態還在探索，《念》是在台中家裡的工作室，從頭至尾都是我一人創作，本來有一位朋友參與混音，但最終我還是選擇自己混音的這版，此時的心態比較安定。</em></h4>\n"

Proxy wars in Vietnam and Korea. The myths of insurmountable religious, ethnic and social differences between nations, spread and enforced by Western imperialists, persist today. But the moment we notice that these rifts were manufactured and shift our attention from the chasm itself to the cause of the quake, the gaps begin to close.</p>\n<p>The countries of what we call East Asia hold on to so much animosity between them over history and cultural differences that, indeed, would have existed in some form even without Western intervention in the region. And yet, despite the often intense nationalism within these countries, Westerners struggle to tell them apart and Asians who grow up in the West often end up making friends of the people their families might consider enemies. In the Asian diasporic communities of the U.S., Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans are often joined by Southeast Asians and become Asian Americans together. It&#8217;s an odd silver lining of our othering: We are told that we are the same, and find unity and community through sharing that arbitrary label.</p>\n<p>The aim of FAR—NEAR is to challenge Orientalist perspectives of Asia and offer space for creatives to share their own narratives. We would not be having a conversation about bringing together creatives from across Asia if boundaries on the Eurasian continent had not been established by Orientalists. We might not have thought to find this community in the first place. The fact is that we have been labeled and defined. There were many painful repercussions. But for better or worse, we are now here, overcoming differences both real and invented, responding to our othering through togetherness. Here are the stories of FAR—NEAR contributors in New York and LA, caught in limbo between East and West, who found themselves somewhere in between.</p>\n",

              "text": "<p>My ethnicity is Japanese. The labels I use for myself depend on the setting. Sometimes I say I’m Japanese-American, for example in work environments within the U.S., in school or with people I know but am not super close with. I’m Asian to people that I’m just getting to know in the U.S. I’m American to the Japanese people I work with — or at least they call me this, even if it’s not a label I would choose for myself. I’m Japanese to my family and friends and when I travel because of my passport. And I’m a New Yorker. I always am a New Yorker in the back of my mind.</p>\n<p>Growing up, I was taught that Japanese people are hard-working, unique and spiritual, and polite and respectful to others. After I moved to the U.S. my views on Japan and my people shifted with experience and comparison. I still believe that Japanese people are spiritual and unique, but they can also be proud, depressed, avoidant, and love being in control.</p>\n<p>I’ve been mistaken for Korean, Mongolian, Filipina, Chinese, half-Asian. When that happens, I just tell them the truth. I am sometimes mistaken for another ethnicity when being cat-called. In the past I ignored it, but now I let them know.</p>\n<p>There have also been times when I am described as a “surprising” or “bad” Japanese. I get more worked up when non-Asians try to dictate how Asians should be, or when non-Japanese tell me how they think Japanese should be, than when I am mistaken for a different ethnicity. I’ve also been told by my own people that I’m very un-Japanese. I’m not sure what people want from me, but I’ve come to the conclusion that I just am. I take it as a good sign when people can’t identify me or are confused by what I look like.</p>\n<p>I don’t argue against people from other Asian backgrounds on their views about Japanese culture except when they idolize Japan too much. This happens a lot on the topic of anime/manga fandom. While I’m happy that it is appreciated so globally, it’s problematic — to say the least — that the lolita-complex culture has normalized the fetishization of seemingly underage kids (or &#8220;small adults&#8221;) of all genders through anime/manga. The history of Japan has been a bloodbath of colonization, war and ignorant or cruel character-deprecatory views of other Asian countries which I definitely don’t agree with and work against. I try to educate myself beyond what I’ve been taught by Japanese textbooks so I can reflect and have discussions with conscience about my Japanese identity and its history.</p>\n<p>I find it sweet when I’m interacting with my people in Japan. Oftentimes I get teary-eyed just from simple interactions, like being given an umbrella by people at the teishoku-ya on a rainy day. Or when older ladies in the neighborhood give me a nod and tell me it’s hot outside while they water their flowers. I find that I’m being protected and cared for by my people. I decided to take these sweet moments as they come, because they are as true as the differences between us created by the variance in our exposure to local and global issues and socioeconomic conditions. When I meet other people from Asian diasporas, I feel excited to get to know them and am always curious about their stories. I’d like to know what it was like for them. It’s almost like we promised to meet at some point, and took different routes to get there.</p>\n"

              "text": "<p>I was born in Georgia but spent the first six years of my life in Seoul. I recently went back for the first time in over 20 years as a gyopo (Korean American) and experienced some culture shock. Mainly I experienced a lot of sexism and there’s a big issue of gender inequality in South Korea. Many people still don’t recognize the gay or trans communities either. I feel like the country possesses an innately progressive spirit, but the older generations and their conservatism can hold that back. I also couldn’t identify with the heavy beauty-industrial complex. But paradoxically when you get to know Koreans, they are and will always be very deep people who care about preserving their culture and that&#8217;s what makes them truly beautiful. Because I was managing an underground club/bar, I met creatives from different subcultures. There&#8217;s a punk and skate scene I didn’t know about. One common situation for the diaspora community is not feeling entirely accepted in one’s home country once going back but never feeling rooted in the states either, and I&#8217;ve experienced that as well.</p>\n<p>When I was younger I was taught that growing up in a Korean household or going to a Korean church meant I had to be like other Koreans and it made me think of the culture as very strict and homogenous. During the ‘90s, the term “Asian American” hadn’t actualized for me yet. I don’t think it was until the 2000s that it started showing up on standardized tests at school, as opposed to “Asian/Pacific Islander.” Early on I was always torn between being one or the other; my parents would tell me I’m Korean, not American, and I didn’t know I could be both or what that meant.</p>\n<p>I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood in Virginia and the Asians were either Korean, Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, or Filipino. During my adolescence I was one of those who tried to fight cultural stereotypes by unsubscribing from my “Asianness” as much as I could, but as an adult I feel more connected to my Korean culture and upbringing.</p>\n<p>In that sense I’ve developed more of an affinity towards other Asian Americans as I’ve gotten older and have more Asian friends now than I think I&#8217;ve ever had. The food scene in New York has for sure contributed to that. I used to work at several Japanese restaurants so I made Japanese friends that way. I lived with a roommate who is Indian American and we first bonded over making curry together because it was a common dish we shared from our childhood. Even though I grew up eating the Japanese version (karē) I learned it was the British who brought it over to Japan from India originally. So we have white people to thank for that. Food is also a part of different ceremonial traditions across Asia. A friend&#8217;s mother cooked an Iranian dinner once to celebrate Nowruz, the Persian New Year and it reminded me so much of how Korean families celebrate Seollal.</p>\n<p>I get asked if I’m Japanese or Chinese often, sometimes by other Koreans. At my age now I don&#8217;t feel insulted if someone mistakes me for another ethnicity, and I know I&#8217;ve done it too. Recently I took a 23andMe test and found out I’m 6% Japanese and there’s traces of Chinese and Mongolian (and some Native American DNA) so I guess we never know if they could be right either.</p>\n<p>I talk a lot about my family history and ancestors’ roles in the Korean liberation movement during the Japanese Imperial occupation, and the Japanese government’s unwillingness to apologize for their crimes. I do have Japanese American friends whom I feel comfortable having these discussions with, and it’s partly due to us being part of a younger generation. Our ancestors have all lived through oppression and war so we usually have more things to agree on. Most of my Asian friends acknowledge this part of history so it feels redundant when I talk about it, but when I do I am mostly thinking about my American friends who idolize Japanese culture that aren&#8217;t really aware.</p>\n"

There were many voices that influenced me to create a perceived system of value between Filipinx and other Asian cultures. I definitely felt ashamed towards my own culture because, besides typical stereotypes, there was not much representation or recognition of our rich history in American art and media. There is more to Filipinx culture that I wish could be explored and highlighted.</p>\n<p>I am often mistaken as Chinese, Japanese, and/or Vietnamese. It can sometimes be frustrating depending on the situation, but I’ve learned not to take it to heart. I find it fascinating to see how different individuals, Asian or non-Asian, can perceive you. They can draw assumptions through the group of Asians I am around, the way I dress or the type of makeup I choose to express that day, my tan in the summer vs. the paleness of my skin in the winter; even my name is a factor that can definitely influence my mislabeling.</p>\n<p>Recently I have been trying to reclaim and learn more about my culture because I rejected it when I was younger. I am currently building a community to understand the Filipinx diaspora. I have not had any heated arguments with my friends, but I have experienced a few instances where friends deny certain historical events or racial experiences that they feel do not apply to them. I enjoy listening to their point of view. We are all accessing our culture through various lenses and filters.</p>\n<p>I met many young creatives when I visited the Philippines in 2019. I found that we have a similar view of the Western and strict religious upbringing imposed upon us by contemporary society. However, a language barrier made it difficult for me to connect with a few individuals. I also inherently felt like a foreigner because of the way I present myself and the way I was brought up. It was obvious I could not emulate or understand their mannerisms. Although the one thing that made me feel closely connected to the people and to the culture is my love for and familiarity with Filipinx food.</p>\n<p>In comparison to my mixed, Asian and non-Asian diasporic friends, we collectively understand what it means to be treated as an &#8220;outsider” and to be fetishized. Funnily enough we all have similar feelings of guilt from our parents that left their country with the promise of the &#8220;American Dream.&#8221;</p>\n"

              "text": "<p>My father is Italian-American from the Bronx and my mother is Taiwanese. I identify most with being from New York. I grew up with my father, so I didn&#8217;t have any direct connection to my Taiwanese side as a child, though he brought me weekly to primarily Indian and Filipino Yogic and Korean Daoist group meetings. In middle school, most of my friends were from Chinatown and my father remarried to a Thai woman. I feel like I identified often with any Asian community I was introduced to.</p>\n<p>At 19 I took my first trip to Taiwan to meet my mother and her side of the family. Since starting FAR–NEAR and spending more time there, I’ve come to identify more with the culture. Strangely, there are similarities I find between myself and Taiwanese friends or family, even though I was not brought up the same way. I sometimes wonder if genetics do have an influence on personality. Being of mixed heritage, people often like to guess my “makeup.” I’ve felt dehumanized being called &#8220;exotic&#8221; and it definitely affected how I felt about myself in my teenage years. Because I’m considered darker skinned than most East Asians (especially in the summer), I’ve been assumed to be Tahitian or Hawaiian and even called a “forest creature.” While studying in Europe I was often asked why I have &#8220;these eyes&#8221; even though my name is Italian. In the beginning, I felt forced to take these as compliments, as they were usually coming from men as a way to flirt. As I got older and better understood the nuances of labeling others, I was better able to stick up for myself and either dismiss the person altogether or correct them to my personal background.</p>\n<p>Growing up, I definitely surrounded myself with people of other mixed heritage, though not necessarily of Asian descent. I find that overall I feel the most similar to people who were raised with multiple cultures, whether that means having moved around a lot as a child, or having an ethnically diverse family. I think there’s a specific place that most mixed-cultured individuals find themselves in. I call it the “insider/outsider.” In some ways it’s definitely a privilege — we are granted access into multiple communities in a way most people aren’t. At the same time, I think a lot of us feel like drifters. We are never fully comfortable in one culture, nor are we completely accepted. There’s always a bit of an arms-width distance between us and them. Sometimes it’s a language barrier, sometimes it’s cultural, sometimes it’s because of unfair media representations that promote non-Asian features as the ideal. When I was spending some time in Tokyo, a modeling agency told me I was “too Asian” to be represented by them. It’s definitely strange to have some people tell you, “you’re too Asian” while others might say “you’re not Asian enough.” Especially when it’s not in a Western country. I think throughout my life I’ve looked for people who share this similar experience. I’ve heard someone say, “you’re only Asian when not in Asia.” There is definitely this sense of belonging when I visit any Asian city, even outside of Taipei. There’s a sort of familiarity I get with the space and new friends or family, regardless of how much time I spend with them or if we can fully communicate. It almost feels like this understanding or non-verbal intangible form of communication. An unspoken, unlabeled understanding of who we are and how we relate.</p>\n"

I didn’t grow up with Korean culture, although my family took occasional trips to Koreatown restaurants. When I was 8, I was briefly enrolled in a Saturday school for Korean language. It didn’t work out. But because I looked (full) Asian, I identified as Asian. Learning about Asia through pop culture, I latched onto Japanese culture. An opportunity turned up, and I started studying Japanese with a tutor when I was 10 years old. I moved to Tokyo for undergrad and spent four years after graduation working for a Japanese newspaper in New York. People are generally shocked to learn that I’m not Japanese. I often think that if K-pop had been as big when I was a kid as it is now, I’d be fluent in Korean and not Japanese.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been adamant about correcting people when they mistake me for being another ethnicity. Growing up, I’d get cat-called with “nihao” or “konnichiwa,” but never “annyeong.” It bothered me that Korea was forgotten. I’m always torn on how to respond when I’m mistaken for being Japanese. I usually choose to go through the whole explanation. You really can’t ever assume someone’s identity.</p>\n<p>When I was living in Japan I met a few people who hated Koreans. It was eye-opening for me, coming from New York where Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese people belonged to one group: Asians. These Korea-haters (read: racists) reassured me that I was not like those other Koreans. I was half white, and an American, so it canceled my Korean-ness. I’ve since become quite vocal when it comes to calling out racism in Japan, especially because so many believe it doesn’t exist. I truly love Japan, and am honored to have been so welcomed there. Japanese people joke about how “Japanese” I am, and we have a good laugh together.</p>\n<p>But because I am Korean by blood — even if I have no cultural connection to the country at all, I hurt when I hear words of hate against Koreans as if they were meant for me. I felt a sense of belonging somehow hearing about Japan’s ethnic zainichi Korean population. Our experiences are so different, yet somehow familiar.</p>\n<p>At home in New York, I find I am most able to connect with mixed-race people, Asian Americans and third culture kids. People whose identities aren’t straightforward. Even though I didn’t learn Asian culture from my parents, the experiences I faced just looking Asian overlap so much with other Asian people. We share our experiences getting cat-called by men with Asian fetishes, told to “go back to China” or complimented on our English abilities. We’re brought together through sharing our struggles, but that’s always been how some of the strongest bonds are formed.</p>\n"

I use the label of Black and Chinese for myself.</p>\n<p>Growing up, I was taught about Malay culture through the food my mom cooked and the habits and superstitions she retained from her life in Malaysia. I was exposed to Malaysian cartoons and my mom’s stories. But none of my mom’s family live in the U.S. so it was a relatively distant culture for me and still is. I was exposed to and lived in a community with many other Asian families from all different countries throughout my social life growing up. The Asian population in my hometown is large and I was certainly exposed to a lot of cultural points, particularly of East Asian cultures, because of that. The smells, sensations and behavioral leanings of my Asian friends and their homes are foundational for me. That being said, because my mom does not identify as Chinese (she was adopted by a Malay family at birth) and because we didn’t have a community of Malay people in Michigan, I felt separate from other Asian cultures on a more intimate level. I believed those cultures to be separate from mine but also to be valuable, intricate and strong.</p>\n<p>I do sometimes discuss cultural or historical issues with friends. There aren’t arguments — it’s still an exploration for me. It’s a newer thing for me to even unpack that part of my identity as both aspects of my ethnic background have been buried under ambiguity for so long. In general, I feel very different from my other Asian friends.</p>\n<p>Being in Asia has always been a positive experience for me. In Malaysia, I fit in quite well because of the way I look. I feel that I am seen more as an interesting American person when I’m there. Being around Asian Americans can sometimes make me fearful because I am hesitant about whether I’ll be accepted or taken seriously.</p>\n"

              "text": "<p>As a chronically ill neurodivergent non-binary queer Vietnamese-American, how my intersectional existence fits into my cultural heritage is a an ongoing work in progress. Like other events, the details of any person’s life may be conceptually organized, patterned, and thus understood, explained and managed — making meaning of this existence — but a voice can only articulate what it comprehends. These words will likely fail me, but I’ll persist anyway: initiating a process of carving significance.</p>\n<p>Being a refugee is very different from immigration. Immigration is a choice, whereas relocation as a refugee is a matter of necessity for survival. When you enter this country as a refugee, assimilation is required — not solely by this new culture, but also of/by the original culture; where conceptions of success are materially defined and failure could result in shame for the entire family. Blending in is the goal, but there is also pressure to embody an ideal representation of the original culture.</p>\n<p>Separate from this, refugees arrive in “anywhere, USA”  and while they’re safe from bombs, they are not safe from racism and hate crimes. How exactly does a stranger from a different shore “blend in,” within a culture marked by racism?</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, there aren’t many countries where marginalized identities are acknowledged and accepted as deserving of the same respect and dignity as the rest. As the daughter of Vietnamese refugees, the word ‘displaced’ covers a lot of ground here. Combined with disability, neurodivergence, and gender divergence — do I fit or belong anywhere?</p>\n<p>Because of the fairness of my skin, it’s often assumed that I’m mixed-race and half white. I’m used to it now, but have lost patience for those unwilling to empathize with the complexity of ethnicity.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s important to have these conversations, but usually find that I’ve been misunderstood again and there is sometimes competitiveness along with an assumed hierarchy of cultures (i.e. colonization).</p>\n<p>It’s often difficult for me to elaborate on my lived experience because most people aren’t willing to take the time to appreciate the nuance and intricacies of existence. Ableism, internalized and externalized, overshadows these discussions and I struggle to effectively communicate across neurotypes, with my neurotypical peers. The most organic way for me to communicate is in the visual and somatic realms, through my art.</p>\n<p>We’re privileged to live in a time where interracial relationships have become more accepted — most children in the future will be of mixed backgrounds. In my work, I’m striving to build bridges between communities, celebrating both our similarities and differences. I want weirdo multicultural kids in rural America to feel comforted knowing they’re not alone in this world.</p>\n<p>When I was 17, my mom saved up for a family trip to take my sister and I to Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. I remember being so excited to go back to “the motherland,” to be surrounded by other jungle babies like myself and to experience these cultures firsthand — only to arrive as a privileged American in their eyes. While disorienting in that respect, it was still very grounding to see the same dirt roads with the same neighbors, where my mom grew up in Laos. This trip was actually her first time being in Vietnam because both of my Vietnamese parents were born and raised in Laos, their parents having fled Vietnam due to war.</p>\n<p>Admittedly, I grew up feeling disoriented and still do. I know I’m not alone in this feeling. I would like to experience more compassion in relation to this, to find a shared footing with others who share similar experiences.</p>\n<p>How can we better locate ourselves? Where have we come from? Where are we going? Where are we? We can only listen, resonate to affinities, send out questions, listen for answers, send out more questions. We can only continuously echo-locate, re-locate ourselves, and practice compassion.</p>\n"

In the article, he reveals the condescension he faced from a mostly white group of curators for daring to put together a show that commented on the commodification and appropriation of yoga. We spoke with Bhakta, an outspoken antiracist, about racism in the American art world, and the personal experiences that shaped his work.</p>\n<p><i>Edited excerpts from the conversation follow.<br />\n</i><br />\n<em><strong>Chiraag Bhakta</strong></em> I grew up in New Jersey and my parents grew up in Gujarati farming villages in India. In the late ‘60s they got arranged, and a couple weeks later my dad came over to the States because he was accepted to a college in Philly to get a master’s degree in chemistry. After the British left India in ‘47, the Russians were poaching talent and so the U.S. followed with a test program of 100 visas per year. They stopped that and said only people looking to get their master’s or doctorates can come here. My dad was a part of that wave. So the way that the U.S. government designed the Indian-American community is very specific, just like they do with every community they invite. They built a community of people with master’s and Ph.D.s, and used the community as a tool — I think Reagan was the first to popularize the term “model minority” — and said, “hey, look at the Indian American community! Why can’t you other communities do that?” Go fuck yourself, you design each community in different ways. Don&#8217;t use us as an example to put down another community while you benefit from it. It gets really troubling when all of a sudden the community itself acts like a puppet and starts saying the same thing.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ariana King</strong></em> So in your community you met a lot of people who bought into the “model minority” myth?<b><br />\n</b><br />\n<em><strong>Chiraag</strong></em> Yeah, a big part of it. It’s being talked about now, but I think it’s deep-rooted, especially with the colonial past. There’s a lot of layers to unlearn and we’re having to look at the structure in a different way from what was instilled in us.</p>\n<p>Eventually my parents saved enough money and got the community’s help to lease and eventually buy a motel in New Jersey which we also called home. This  became a hub for the extended family to come into America. There’s this whole community of Gujarati Americans that live and work in motels. I’ve been working on an <b><a href=\"https://www.pardonmyhindi.com/work/#/motel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ongoing project</a></b> since 2005 photo documenting and collecting around the community. Ten photos from that were part of an exhibition at the Smithsonian in D.C. in 2014. It was really my first big look into these big [art] institutions. That was the same year I showed “#WhitePeopleDoingYoga.” I wasn’t sure I wanted to be a part of it. But I remember them saying “if it’s not part of the Smithsonian, it’s not part of American history.” It’s like, fuck. In a way they’re right, and it’s kind of gross — we see who controls the narrative and we’re seeing it being fought. Obviously I ended up deciding to contribute to the exhibition. But going through those experiences and seeing how the Asian Art Museum wanted to mold my voice into a voice they felt comfortable with&#8230;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

And they’re just going to put it in the basement of the museum, and it goes into another person’s collection. The objects in the museum were stolen. [Brundage] was a looter. We’ve seen it with the British museum — “well, if we have to give up one piece, we have to give up everything.” It’s like that one string of the sweater that unravels everything. So I feel like there has been change, but they’re making cosmetic changes rather than real structural changes that need to be made. For one thing, the breakdown of the Asian Art Museum’s staff is 50% white. Some of lead curaters are white. I’m not saying white people can’t work there, but if these leaders were really on the same page and want to be allies, they would be stepping down and trying to put a person of color or of Asian representation to lead these departments. Hmm, are people really willing to let go of power? Probably not. But that being said, I don’t think diversity alone is going to solve it. It’s the whole structure of a museum like that and what it represents — Orientalism and all that shit. They’re trying to throw diversity on it. Diversity is great but it’s that structure that we need to focus on, and that can easily be distracted by diversity.</p>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Ariana</strong></em> What could be a good first step then, beyond “throwing diversity” on the problem?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Chiraag</strong></em> I really think institutions like this need to be dismantled. This is stuff they don’t want to hear — they want to exist. It’s hard to talk about.  The control needs to be decentralized from its donor and owner class, it needs to be grassroots.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ariana</strong></em> Though I wonder — maybe I’m biased because I work within the structure — but what I see from a younger generation and what I’m hoping to be a part of is, just steal away with the skills and networks that we can get from these very well-funded institutions, and once we have that, put it somewhere else. What we’re trying to do with FAR—NEAR is give the mic back to Asian artists. We want to move away from those Orientalist perspectives and reshape the conversation.<br />\n<b><br />\n</b><em><strong>Chiraag</strong></em> So you’re building a new structure.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ariana</strong></em> Right. Because I know it’s hard: how do you build from nothing? You need to kind of use what’s already there. So I think your working with the Smithsonian gave you a platform, but once you have the resources, you can put them elsewhere. I think if we choose to spend our money on supporting “up-and-coming” artists, artists of color who aren’t able to move within the structure — we can use what we have to create our own structures.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Chiraag</strong></em> You’re right. Why ignore those resources? Pull from that shit. The progressive people within those institutions will be part of that dialogue and pull those resources outside of that structure. But we’re seeing people that — it doesn’t matter if they’re white or Asian — they’re part of that structure that is feeding white supremacy.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ariana</strong></em> Right.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Chiraag</strong></em> So what I’m saying is, even if it’s a diverse board — and I’ve seen it, experienced it at other institutions — they elect the first non-white head curator at a major institution, but when you look at what they’re actually doing it’s just like, man, you’re just another mouthpiece. It’s really frustrating. They might get away with more because they don’t have a white face. I felt it was my responsibility as an Indian American to call out the largest institution of Asian arts in America. All of these institutions are using black lives as a marketing trend, but some aren’t getting called out because they’re “diverse.” That <i>agenda</i> is still there, and I feel like it’s our responsibility to call out these institutions, even the ones that don’t have a white facade, and to really check them.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Works like “One Land To Another” and “Temporarily Censored Home” come to mind specifically.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Guanyu Xu</strong></em> I came to the States in 2014, arriving in Chicago during a bad winter. I was a transfer student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). Before I had studied photography at Beijing Film Academy, where I had taken elective classes that dealt with industrial style filmmaking. That was where I gained knowledge of Hollywood films, but not critically. It talked about how to make a great commercial film instead of talking about the history of racism or how demonized people of color are in Hollywood films. At that moment, I was merely absorbing racist representations without knowing it was racism. When I got to SAIC, I took classes on race in cinema and Asian representation in film—I started to learn more critical theory towards media and culture.</p>\n<p>So at that point I started the project “One Land To Another,” which became a slowly growing project. I started taking portraits dealing with fear and safety, as a person who just came out. I was also taking images of American landscapes to get to know the US a little better. Before, I was merely absorbing the landscapes, the ideology and the cultural values from Hollywood movies in China. Then I started to make portraitures with other gay men that I found on dating apps. I collaborated with them to show different relations and confront the lack of Asian representation. If you think of fine art photography, you don’t see many Asian bodies and if you think of mainstream cultural productions, you don’t see many Asian or Asian gay characters in film or TV shows.</p>\n<p>“One Land To Another” thinks about how to create cinematic stills to show different narratives through photography. And it also started to deal more and more with politics after Trump&#8217;s election. In grad school, I used the breaks to go to LA and Philly to take images for “One Land To Another”. I was thinking about different geographic locations, how I would encounter new personalities and create images that are more deliberately thinking about the backdrop of the election, of Trump, and use of themes on neo-nationalism or even white supremacy. That was in the back of my mind. Like you see images where I&#8217;m with another person holding a shower curtain of the map of the world, which belongs to the person. I was deliberately thinking of how to perform for the camera and perform for the viewer to send a message. So it&#8217;s alway kind of changing, the project is always mutating because the world and my worldview is changing.</p>\n"

I took two trips during grad school where I printed out images, folded them in a cardboard box and put them in my luggage to bring back to Beijing. While my parents were gone, I hung those images in the apartment and eventually documented the installation as photographs. The images in the installation are combinations of portraitures of both me with other gay men, but also torn pages from Hollywood film magazines and fashion magazines with male models that I collected growing up in Beijing. So thinking of the juxtaposition, I had the history of consuming these cultural products and then eventually I came to the US and I suddenly realized those images were not neutral. They embedded a certain desire; they created a hegemony where I would never really feel completely free.</p>\n<p>Those images, they were created for only certain types of people, mainly for white middle class Americans that believe the US is the best country in the world; that only believe in heterosexual relations. They also grew up consuming films that created yellow peril, dragon lady and yellowface. We are still dealing with whitewashing in Hollywood. So thinking about how I juxtapose my response and my performative self-portraits with other men, those images formulate my desire and create a clash in this space, so I can eventually generate a new potential future for myself.</p>\n<p>I think the work challenged the really conservative aspect of growing up in Beijing, specifically with my parents. But it is also a comparative examination between the US and China—in a way both societies limited my freedom differently.</p>\n"

A lot of this was embedded in your work before the coronavirus crisis, but how has it now impacted your work?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Guanyu</em></strong> In general, politicians and normal Americans never really reflected on the history of anti-Chinese sentiments or slavery. So racism didn&#8217;t really go away, it was just hidden. The type of scapegoating Trump used in 2016—you see him using a similar strategy of scapegoating now. Most of the time, I stay at home. In my neighborhood, there are a lot of Asians and Mexicans in the community; it’s pretty safe for me. I have a studio that&#8217;s an hour away by public transportation, but I&#8217;ve completely avoided going there because it&#8217;s not safe in terms of corona, but it’s also not safe for me to potentially encounter lots of people. So i think it&#8217;s just sad that xenophobia is happening because people are not really educating themselves, but the larger media and the education system in the US—they are now trying to educate people to better understand history and what’s going on.</p>\n"

              "text": "<p><em><strong>Sandy</strong></em> Physical spaces seem to be a big part of your work. What is it like for you now in terms of limitations with space?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Guanyu</strong></em> I was actually working on a new project called “Resident Alien.” I was planning to photograph people I knew who needed to get a new visa because they were ending their student visa, or they were dealing with H-1B or O-1 visas. People that have stayed in the US for a pretty long time, but they are still trying to figure out their visas—people like me. And I was planning to take images in their home and then bring printed images to install in their places. This was thinking about how their house in the US is always in a really temporary state because at any moment their visa could be revoked; it was thinking about Trump&#8217;s recent suspension of immigration visas and green cards. Because of the virus, I cannot really go to my friends’ places to take new images, just thinking about the safety of everyone. I also don&#8217;t have access to printers. Everything is suspended. I’m trying to work virtually, I had this video work called “Complex Formation” where I used 3D animation and 3D generated images with dialogue between me and my mother. So right now I&#8217;m trying to work virtually to create collages.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sandy</em></strong> Has being in a contained space given you a different inspiration?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Guanyu</em></strong> I don&#8217;t think coronavirus has given me any new inspiration. It&#8217;s just made me feel completely drained. It’s really difficult for me. I started worrying in early January because my parents were in Beijing and what was going on in China was horrific. Everyday I would wake up and check different news about the situation and in February I saw everything was going better in China because of the lockdown. And at the end of January, I was worrying about what was going to happen in Chicago. It seemed to be fine, but it was just the appearance of fine. At that time, Americans still didn’t believe in wearing masks, they didn&#8217;t believe the virus could be transmitted so easily and at such a high rate. You didn’t see much in terms of government action or media action to talk about it. So I also let my guard down and I was not really worried too much anymore. But then in March, everything started to become real. I went to NY for the Armory Show at the beginning of March and I had this constant debate of “Should I wear a mask in the subway?” or “Will I be targeted by people who think I have the virus?” I was so anxious when I was there.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sandy</strong></em> Did you end up wearing a mask?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Guanyu</strong></em> I was in NY for 4-5 days; I was wearing a mask when I landed, in the airplane, and then I wore it in the subway to my hotel. After that, I think I only wore it once in 5 days. I was anxious because at that time, it was already on the news about people being targeted and attacked.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sandy</strong></em> What&#8217;s the overall reaction you’ve gotten to your work since it is so much more out of the mainstream?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Guanyu</strong></em> I think most people are really fascinated by the fact that my parents still don&#8217;t know about the installation. They never thought I would ever really be that big and on the internet. If you use the Chinese version of Google to search my name, you will find my website. So if they look for it they will see it, but not so far.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sandy</strong></em> What would be your ideal take away from someone looking at your work? Now that you are putting out a more inclusive view of what it is to be Asian.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Guanyu</strong></em> Probably for lots of people, especially the self-portraitures with other men, they’ll think, “This is such a gay work” showing this nude intimacy, which I’m fine with. For people who are more curious, who read my statement and go to the exhibitions to learn a little bit more, I would hope they can understand what I&#8217;ve been talking about.</p>\n"

If you&#8217;re being too comfortable, then you will only know that it&#8217;s a work about this guy subverting his parents home. But once you get a little deeper and know what&#8217;s going on with the different images and what&#8217;s going on in each image, you will learn a little more. Since the work has already been done, I don&#8217;t have much control over what people think. I try my best to push myself, to question myself about how to not create a simple work and to create something that&#8217;s layered—something that&#8217;s dealing with both history and ongoing events. It&#8217;s dealing with different spaces; it’s dealing with personal space but also the political space between the US and China, or even Europe. As an artist, I don&#8217;t think I can force any viewer to think a certain way; the work is there and we all have the power to decide if we want to educate ourselves or if we want to learn a little more.</p>\n"

Different topics of girlhood are explored, from the One Child Policy in which girls were less valued then boys, often leading to extreme cases of illegal abortions, to other depictions of the relationship between girls and money, arranged marriages, homemaking and wifehood. The pictures themselves are playful– in one image, Sophie is seen surrounded by her Grandmother’s antiques. These playful images, however, also serve as commentary on China&#8217;s complex relationship between girl and woman, childhood and adulthood, and the expectations both for the individual and the collective sex.</p>\n",

              "text": "<p><em><strong>FAR–NEAR</strong></em> Where did you grow up? How has that shaped you as a human and as an artist?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Taigen</strong></em> I&#8217;m originally from Tokyo, Japan, I moved to London when I was 18. I can divide my youth into these two parts.</p>\n<p>I grew up in Shibuya, spending an hour to go to primary school by train. Playing with friends on the weekend were a special treat for me. I don’t feel local to anywhere. I didn’t have school friends that lived near me, and I never had a localized accent, compared to other Japanese people I meet in London who come from a specific region. Growing up in the city made me learn how to play by myself.</p>\n<p>I started playing music in high school, becoming more active and meeting many different people. Tokyo was a great environment to learn music. There’s access to so many venues and record shops, everything is so convenient. At the same time, Tokyo almost has too much convenience, too much information and noise. This has shaped my style in music and art for sure.</p>\n<p>London was a completely different environment when I first decided to move. I have learned so much about ‘indie music,” especially what I didn&#8217;t like about it. I was inspired more by bass music/sound system and the diversity of the London metropolis. The variety of cultures, thoughts and religions made me re-think how I grew up in Japan. I&#8217;m still Japanese and proud but I would also call myself an alien now.</p>\n<p><strong><em>FAR–NEAR</em></strong> What’s the most important thing in life?</p>\n<p><strong><em>Taigen</em></strong> Even though I often ask myself &#8220;do I still love music?&#8221; My answer would be music. If I hadn’t started playing, I probably would not be living in London right now. Music definitely gave me hope and a reason to live. It brought me to many different countries and I have met so many people through it. I am always thankful for the people and places I have been, and I owe it to music.</p>\n<p><em><strong>FAR–NEAR</strong></em> Where do you find inspiration?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Taigen</strong></em> Pro-wrestling is my main inspiration, it was my biggest obsession before I got into music. I’ve always been captivated by how wrestlers use their bodies, how they posture, move and most importantly express through their faces. Wrestling entrance music was also my favorite music when I was younger. It is a mix between 80&#8217;s metal, rap, disco, techno, and many other kinds of music.</p>\n<p><em><strong>FAR–NEAR</strong></em> When do you feel your most vulnerable?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Taigen</strong></em> When I&#8217;m onstage. I feel simultaneously strong and extra sensitive in front of all those people.</p>\n<p><em><strong>FAR-NEAR</strong></em> What do you feel should be the relationship between masculinity and vulnerability?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Taigen</strong></em> Growing up in Tokyo and London, I feel as though I’ve avoided the stereotypical sense of masculinity in myself. If I grew up in different city, I might have felt pressure to be more masculine. I do feel like nowadays, we are gradually changing globally where you no longer need to prove your masculinity in order to protect yourself or belong. I respect people who go against societal pressures, especially in relation to gender norms. We all have to be ourself, there’s no need to put ourselves in one category.</p>\n<p><em><strong>FAR–NEAR</strong></em> Who were your idols growing up?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Taigen</strong></em> So many wrestlers, and Les Claypool (from Primus) is my forever bass hero.</p>\n<p><em><strong>FAR–NEAR</strong></em> What do you want to see changed in your society?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Taigen</strong></em> I want people to be able to express themselves freely, whether through thought, music or personality.</p>\n"

Most of my close friends are active in punk in one way or another. I get jaded, but it&#8217;s exciting to stop and think about what people have accomplished and what futures lay ahead of them. And it&#8217;s some of the best work&#8211;audio or visual&#8211;in terms of what you might call outsider art/punk. Because it&#8217;s a group of so many creative people, interesting collaborations arise, and I&#8217;m lucky to have made music videos for some of these bands, and to have gained some level of recognition from people involved in this community globally.</p>\n<p><strong>FAR–NEAR </strong>What&#8217;s your favorite claymation?</p>\n<p><strong>Robin </strong>I don&#8217;t have a favorite, but I am a fan of how wild and loose Bruce Bickford&#8217;s work is. Honestly, claymation isn&#8217;t as interesting to me as much as animation in general&#8211;I feel like it tends to get too absorbed by technical execution or too cutesy.  As far as I know, it&#8217;s a medium that hasn&#8217;t really been fleshed out beyond the interests of &#8220;man-children&#8221; or actual children, the way animation in general has. I love dinosaurs and robots and chickens and Gumby, but I&#8217;d like to see the medium used for other iconography or for it to use wilder, trippier techniques. That being said, I&#8217;m excited to see Phil Tippett&#8217;s &#8220;Mad God.&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>FAR–NEAR </strong>If there was one person you would want to work with, who would it be?</p>\n<p><strong>Robin </strong>Someone who pays well.</p>\n"

In San Francisco and at my time at UC Berkeley, I was surrounded by a large Asian American community — to the point where it felt normal to have this sort of kinship. It wasn’t until I photographed a small Chinese population in the Mississippi Delta that I started to fully understand the severity and magnitude of the discrimination and the micro aggressions that other Asian Americans experienced, both as teens and adults.</p>\n<p>In this photo book, I wanted to explore and comment on the physical spaces in which we’ve felt invisible and also celebrate and showcase the tender and intimate beauty of everyday Asian American men.</p>\n<p>Most of the models were friends whose experiences I was already familiar with. I gave them the overall project scope and the vision I had for the set I built for them. I saw it as a very collaborative process and incorporated ideas that they had for each scene. More often than not, these scenes and experiences resonated with all of us.</p>\n"

The traumatic personal experiences elaborated in the stories of friends and novels served as another avenue of inspiration.</p>\n<p>From the “lunch box moments” — where we’ve been shamed for the food we eat — to the absence of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in school, to being called “Oriental” and “Jackie Chan,” and facing a &#8220;bamboo ceiling&#8221; in the corporate world because of our race, Asian American men like myself have always faced a complex ecosystem of obstacles to ever feeling &#8220;American.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em><strong>FAR–NEAR</strong></em> What was it like working in Silicon Valley as an Asian American male?</p>\n<p><em><strong>Andrew</strong></em> In corporate America — including Silicon Valley — there’s a lack of Asian American leadership. When I worked at LinkedIn, I saw less than a handful of Asian leaders in a company of 10,000 employees; this reaffirmed the “bamboo ceiling” I’ve always implicitly felt since I started working. As a result, I felt like I often needed to take up more space in meetings and in my interactions with my colleagues (predominantly white men) — raising and inflecting my voice in a way that made me sound more credible and confident. It was my inauthentic attempt to be more vocal and appear as a capable leader. Because we’re seen as a purely heads-down-and-work type of employee that wouldn’t speak out against any injustice, we’re often overlooked based on our perceived inability to be &#8220;leaders.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

These conversations may be out of your comfort zone, but it’s necessary to push your understanding and self awareness beyond your own world. This could mean going to different events, consuming more content (books, shows, articles, interviews, etc.) outside of what you typically consume, and ultimately being more curious and asking questions to other folks in other communities. The more exposure we have, the more empathy we develop.</p>\n"

These sleeping positions and images are a meditation on the shared connection with a nighttime bedmate.<br />\nDrawn from personal experience with my partner, the positions are a journey to knowing what works best. Handshake, Sweet Spot, Criss-Cross and Tippy Toe represent space and balance, not only in bed but in the patterns of our lives. As I move forward in my creative journey, casting queer people of color empowers me to tell not only my story, but others’ as well.
